            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As for inſtance, is there any thing in the World more Lawfull then Divinity in its purity? and is there any thing more hard to finde, or more commonly abuſed by falſe Tenets, Schiſms, Sects and Hereſies?

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> The ſecond time of my Writing was occaſioned through the weak Arguments, flaſhes and ſuppoſitions of Doctor <hi>Homes,</hi> who (being a Scholler) ſhould (me thinks) have had more underſtanding then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this worthy Art under the notion of Witchcraft, Sorcery, and ſuch like illegalities; or diſcretion, then to rail down one of the chief of the Liberal Sciences, meerly for the abuſes thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> The third was, that I might manifeſt the innocency of this Science, and the legality, verity, excellency and validity thereof, if not abuſed; and therefore who ſo ſhall warily peruſe that Diſcourſe of mine, intituled <hi>Vox Stellarum,</hi> or <hi>The Voice of the STARS,</hi> Printed in the year 1652. ſhall be ſatisfied, that God doth work by Cauſes, and that he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Stars and Celeſtial Planets to be immediate Cauſes next unto Him of all our Natural injoyments and caſualties, <hi>viz.</hi> Fertility, Sterility, Wars, Peace, Health, Sickneſs, Alterations of the Ayr, Inundations, Earthquakes, Thunders, Lightnings, Storms, Tempeſts, Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Troubles, Alteration of States, Kingdoms, Laws, Cuſtoms, and of all things in a Natural way incident to, and in this Elementary World; for there is nothing more certain then that the Portencies of the Stars (ſo far as conduceth to the government of the Natural and Elementary World, and the things therein compoſed of the ſame matter and ſtuff) ſhall prove true and effectual, unleſs God do work a Miracle, and pervert the Order and Government of the World, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I do not deny the omnipotent power of God, that he is able to alter the courſe of Nature; he that made them with and by the word of his mouth, can (queſtionleſs) by the ſame word not only alter their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pervert their effects, but alſo annihilate them again; but as this is not by me denyed, ſo cannot the Objectors againſt this Science but confeſs that God is the God of Order, and worketh in order, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly; for becauſe he can alter the courſe and influence of the Stars, argueth not at all that therefore he will for why ſhould this be any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61337:7"/>to us, ſince we read but of three times he hath wrought in this manner ſince the Creation of the World? <hi>viz.</hi> firſt in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> time when he made the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtand ſtill; the ſecond in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time when he made the <hi>Sun</hi> go back; and the third and laſt time at the paſſion of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> when he miraculouſly Eclipſed the <hi>Sun</hi> at the time of the Full <hi>Moon,</hi> which cauſed <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> thus to burſt forth, <hi>Aut Deus Naturae patitur, aut Mundi machina diſſolvitur,</hi> Either the World is at an end, or the God of Nature ſuffereth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is clear God worketh not, or createth new things; he finiſhed his Work in the firſt ſix days, he therefore now upholdeth all things by his Providence, and bringeth them to paſs by ſecondary cauſes, according unto his inevitable Decrees and Divine Will; for it were great impiety in us, and detraction from the Al-ſufficient Wiſdom and Power of the Almighty, to affirm he hath not preordained all things to come to paſs from the firſt Creation even to the Subverſion; and that they are ſignified unto us in the Heavens, have recourſe to <hi>Gerſon</hi> his <hi>Trilogium Astrologiae Theologizatae;</hi> for we read that before the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> there appeared a Comet in the Heavens in form of a Sword for many days, Horſmen alſo fighting in the Ayr, <hi>Joſephus Bel. Jud. Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Euſebius Eccleſ. Hist.

But this will be very clear unto us even from <hi>The word of GOD,</hi>
               <note place="margin">That Theologie and Aſtrologie agree together.</note> if we but with diligence and obſervation read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the Old Teſtament, of the Subverſion of Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but eſpecially that of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the which People, upon condition they would follow the Law of the Lord, were promiſed to be eſtabliſhed for ever; ſhall any one from this Promiſe aver, that their Kingdom was not preordained to deſtruction in its due time, and the limitation thereof long before ſet down? but that immediatly becauſe they diſobeyed, they were deſtroyed and carried away captive; or rather that that Age wherein they were ſo captivated, ſhould in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that time be ſo inclined to wickedneſs, as to bring that affliction ſo long before threatned upon them? So then theſe two, THEOLOGY and ASTROLOGY muſt agree together, or we ſhall never be able to agree in Truth, but run our ſelves into many Errours and Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>In that Book alſo you may ſee how far we may ſafely attribute to the power of the Stars, and that their effects may be altered, yet but by one means, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer; for if GOD give an heart to pray as it ought, no queſtion he alſo therewith grants the Petition requeſted in thoſe Prayers.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, my main ſcope, and chief drift in this my fourth fourfold
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61337:8"/>Work is (ſince I have ſo often ſtood up for the maintenance of this Science) to endeavour to manifeſt unto the World the purity thereof,<note place="margin">The Authors chief drift in theſe his Labors.</note> having cleanſed it from its pollutions and abuſes, that ſo it may appear what TRUE ASTROLOGY is, and what I maintain to be ſo, and the abuſe be not only diſcovered but taken away, that once more it might ſhine gloriouſly, and be able to ſtand againſt all Gain-ſayers whatſoever: For notwithſtanding I had delivered my ſelf ſo plainly in my former Works, eſpecially in my <hi>Vox Stellarum,</hi> yet did the purity of this Science remain under the cenſure, being by many deemed no other then jugling; by others, to extend no further then to the reſolution of Horary Queſtions and the Judging of Nativities and the Fates and Fortunes of men thereby, or at leaſt that this was the main and chief ſubject thereof, when the truth is, the practiſe of ſome men in theſe ridiculous vanities, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome other abuſes of this MOST NOBLE SCIENCE OF ASTROLOGIE, have brought the purity thereof into queſtion by the unworthy, and the Science it ſelf generally into reproach with the illiterate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But we ſhall ſuppoſe the beſt, that we are ſaved alive, and then again on the other ſide, we ſhall be forc't (ſuch are our innumerable Calamities, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and Diſeaſes, Miſchances, Diſaſters, Troubles, Vexations, Perſecutions, Impriſonments, Fears, Anguiſhes, Diſcontents, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, Diſſentions, Quarrels, Anger, Strife &amp; Debate) with <hi>Job</hi> (<hi>Job</hi> 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,. 12.) to curſe the day of our birth, and to wiſh the womb had been our grave, <hi>Job</hi> 10.18, 19. or that we had died when we firſt were born <hi>Job</hi> 3.11.

How are we ſubject to Meaſels, Small Pox, Scabs, Botches, Boils? How are we tormented with ſuch like infirmities and vexations? How gnawn and pulled with Worms both in the Maw and Belly?

               <note place="margin">The Vanity of our Youth.</note> Let us come now to the fourteenth year of our age, and ſee if we grow wiſer as we grow older. Now we fall in love, fond fools! with what, can we tell? know we why? have we reaſon ſufficient to guid us? have we ſufficient Judgement for theſe our fond and childiſh actions? Is ſhe beautifull? how ſimple are we ſo to beſot our ſelves with that which at the beſt is but uncertain, and with one puff of the ſtormy wind of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Small-Pox, Feaver, or ſuch like, &amp;c. withereth and fadeth? How weak are we to ſhipwrack our Judgements on ſuch quickſands, to build our houſe on ſo tottering a foundation which is impoſſible to ſtand? How childiſh are we ſo to bewitch our ſelves to bare outſides! Catch at ſhadows and neglect ſubſtances! when Vertue, Religion, Chaſtity, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Patience, Prudence, Modeſty ought rather to be the rowling eyes, the love dimples, curled artificial locks, naked breſts, cherry cheeks, coral lips, black eye-brows, lilly white hands, ſoft, gentle &amp; ſlender which we ſhould look too, and covet, and eſteem as the greateſt and chiefeſt beauty, though vaild under a Canveſs Curtain; this is the Jewel rather to be prized of the two, though locked up in an homely Cabinet; this is <hi>that vertuous Woman which ſhall he a Crown to her Husband,</hi> Prov. 12.4. <hi>The glory of the man,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.7. and <hi>the wife that buildeth up her houſe,</hi> Prov. 14.1.

But alas! now we are raſh, indiſcreet, think our own wits beſt; like wilde Bucks; over hedge and ditch we go without fear or wit; reſtrain our ſelves of nothing for theſe ſeven years till we have ſown all our wilde Oats, and come home with weeping croſs; think we have time enough to repent; delay the time; we are young enough, and therefore go on in our ways: O but let us conſider the words of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man, <hi>But know O man that for all this thou ſhalt come to Judgment,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.9. <hi>We ſhall anſwer for every idle word,</hi> Matth. 12.32.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61337:10"/>when we voluntarily run thereinto, and wilfully and willingly give our ſelves over to looſneſs which profiteth not, <hi>but is a great evil and vanity it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How do we Game, Sport, Drink, Rore it, and make Revel-rout, Rant, Cut it, and tear the ground, Vapor, Swagger, Domineer, Stare and Sware, follow a company to do evil, do as our Companions adviſe us, or as we ſee them do, never queſtioning whether there be Reaſon, Wit, Diſcretion or Honeſty in it; Whore, Drab, and take Tobacco, all for company, and ſo deſtroy both body and ſoul, being now for any deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drink healths to our Miſtreſſes till we leave our ſelves no health, and make beaſts of our ſelves in not denying to do that which beaſts cannot be conſtrained to: And truly, this beſtial vice of Drunkenneſs may alſo be reprehended in thoſe of more mature years, nay, to the ſhame of this our Land be it ſpoken, even the moſt grave age of men is too much addicted hereunto; ſo that it is obſervable that hardly any Houſes thrive of late ſince our manifold diſtractions, but tipling and guſling Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, the which as is very well known, are more in number by many then all the inhabitants of other Trades (in <hi>London</hi>) put together; <hi>This alſo is vanity, and a great evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, let us ſee the end of ſuch doings; what advantageth it? doth it produce any good? are not the effects hereof, Quarrels, Diſſentions, Fightings for Miſtreſſes; for not drinking of an Health; for not ſaying this Woman is handſom; for affirming that is not comely; for diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of a Lady, a Perſon of Honour, Quality, Renown, becauſe he hath been admitted her preſence for an affront, nay for a pin, point, or pins-head, muſt they into the field, off with their doublets, and too it, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one another, and then flie, or elſe be catcht and hanged; <hi>This is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity and folly.</hi> It mattereth not with theſe, whether they are Friends, Familiars, or Enemies, if once they are ſet-ont, they muſt kill or be killed, die in a Ditch, and that they call <hi>Honourable, then they die in the bed of honour</hi> (they ſay) and this for the ſmalleſt trifles, as I could te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, might I relate their names, and ſo again revive mens raſhneſs which was but lately acted: However the ſtory of one is thus, Two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this City of <hi>London,</hi> happening to meet together and being very loving Friends and intimate acquaintance, went into one of theſe devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Tipling-houſes, called for a Pot of Ale, the which the one taſting of it commended to be very good; the other was of a clean contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and did altogether as much diſcommend it, thinking no hurt, but that he might freely give alſo his Judgement thereof; but to be ſhort, the other again reitered its excellent goodneſs, and was alſo replyed to the contrary, and ſo they fell to words and at laſt [to end this Whimſical controverſie] they reſolved to kill one another; the day being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and meeting, the one was ſlain; and it was upon a good ground, was it not? yet could nothing ſatisfie theſe hot ſpirits, nor ſtand with their Honours, as they ſuppoſed, but this <hi>madneſs, madneſs, madneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many ſuch like vanities and raſh actions (I ſay) might I here relate; but I fear I ſhould in recording of them render my ſelf moſt vain, and ſhew my own vanity, whilſt I am reprehending it in others: Doth not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61337:10"/>this Drinking and Revelling, which they call good Company-keeping, not only declare it ſelf to be clean contrary thereunto, but alſo ſpoil their ſociety they pretend to enjoy? they meet together, but oftentimes know not how they depart; are not the effects thereof over and above what hath been ſaid, poverty, diſgrace, running in debt, cheating, lying, diſſembling, vain-glory, pride, luſt, prodigality? and when all fails, and Creditors call for their money, will be put off no longer, ſet Sergeants to dog them, and Taylors will furniſh them no more to flant and carry it out for their further running in debt with others unknown unto them; is not their Refuge at laſt to the High-way, turn Cutters, and from thence return to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where too late they Repent, and wiſh any would cut the Rope, but cannot advantage themſelves then, and there's an end of them?</p>
            <p>Poor Wretches! were not they better be old whilſt they are young, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then be hanged, killed, and murthered upon every occaſion before they be old? be grave, ſober, ſerious, then whymſical, fickle and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical? apply their minds to the ſtudy of vertue and the liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, then thus to learn nothing but vice, foolery, foppery, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit? Knowing that their time is ſhort enough to learn good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore not prodigally thus to ſquander it away upon trifles and childiſh conceits: Had they not better be contented with a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and live within compaſs, and addict themſelves to their Book; then flant it, roar and ſwagger it about the ſtreets with the Drapers cloth on their back, the Taylors Workmanſhip, Points and Fancies, and all unpaid for? the Haberdaſhers hat, the ſmirking Semſters half and whole Shirts, Bands, Cuffs and Boot-hoſe-tops, with the Shoe-makers Boots? Like <hi>Eſops</hi> Bird that had borrowed and trict himſelf up with others Feathers, was thought ſome body, ſo that he preſumed to be King, till his Plot was diſcovered, and every Bird took his own again, and left him deſpicable; even ſo do theſe <hi>Chryſalides</hi> carry themſelves high, advance themſelves above their Betters, think every one their inferiour that hath not ſuch gaudy fine quelkeſhoſes about them; and ſo forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelvs, they run headlong into many abſurdities and Premuniries, being applauded of the World for this their outſide, though vitious, (which had every one his own, he would be ſpeedily ſtript of, and left as naked as any Nayl) not inſide, although vertuous, if outwardly mean; <hi>This is alſo vanity.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If he want money, what miſery is he overcharged with! a continual fear poſſeſſeth his Spirits, that he ſhall ſtarve, lie in Gaol, have no friend, abound with diſgraces, ſlights, frowns and affronts, even from the moſt rural, although never ſo well deſerving; is he not then ready to take any deſperate courſe and deſign in hand? and is not this troubleſom, loathſom, abominable life enough to make him do that which in his own natural humour he ever deteſted? <hi>Is not this vanity and folly then? ſure it is a great evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hath he a competency [which is the golden mean to be deſired of all men] yet he is not content, he muſt have more, he lives not ſo high as his Neighbours, his Wife and Children flant it not like them, he hath not his Coach, Saddle-horſes for himſelf, and a couple of men, nor the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, cap in hand that he ſees others have; O miſerable man! how vain art thou, that thou knoweſt not thine own happineſs? Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the chiefest gain: and as one moſt elegantly ſaid, <hi>It is not the abundance of Riches or Poſſeſsions a man hath, that maketh him Rich, but the contentedneſs of this minde.</hi> For how many old, grubbing Uſurers (who as <hi>Anacharſis</hi> ſaid, carry Gold like Aſſes, yet eat but Hay) pine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? feed upon porridge a whole half year together, make a penny ſerve them a day, will not beſtow a farthing to the making themſelves well when ſick, for fear of parting with their <hi>Mammon-money,</hi> although but a trifle; but chooſe rather to put it to the venture, and let it wear away (as they uſe to ſay) when oftentimes it wears them away, or at leaſt bears them away; and ſo are juſtly diſſipated of all, for fearing to part with ſome. Are not theſe men wretched, poor, even whilſt they poſſeſs the greateſt Riches? Is there any of them can afford themſelves neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries? do they not live more like Beggars, or Peaſants [at the beſt] then rich and wealthy men?</p>
            <p>And now I might here ſhew the odiouſneſs and vitiouſneſs of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which of all things is moſt deteſtable; but I fear I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tranſgreſſed the ordinary bounds of an Epiſtle; wherefore leaſt the Porch of this my Fabrick ariſe to a greater bulk then the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall paſs it by.</p>
            <p>And truly to go on in this I am upon (without branching it in the leaſt) were an <hi>Herculean Labour,</hi> and to inſiſt on every particular vanity in this vain, vain, vain World; Beſides ſhould I be ſo peremptory as to attempt it, my preſent condition, want of memory, and inſufficient capacity, would render me defective in as many things as I have already or can hereafter expreſs, and my vanity therein the greateſt of vanities; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as hitherto I have but hinted at things, being (as I have ſaid) not

            <p>Is he ſingle? he deſires marriage; Is he married? he deſires again to be ſingle; as the ſtory goes of a fellow which whilſt he was a batchelor, was a boon-companion, and would ſpend his mony freely, and therfore with his Hoſts he was termed <hi>A good fellow;</hi> but ſo it happened, that at length he was married, and coming not ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Hoſts as formerly, nor ſpending his caſh ſo freely when he came, was by one of them demanded the reaſon of this his unwonted ſtrangeneſs and great change; who replying, ſaid, <hi>I am now married;</hi> why then quoth ſhe, <hi>Thou art now an honest man;</hi> but he ſighingly made anſwer in theſe words, <hi>Ha, but if I were once a good fellow again, I would never be an honest man whilst I live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee we are never content with our condition, neither full nor faſting. How are we grieved and perplexed at the loſs of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Wife, Children, Goods? And how again do we fret, pine and conſume our Spirits, Bodies and Souls, that we cannot be rid of our Husbands, Wives and Children? How careleſs are we of them when we have them?

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61337:12"/>in moſt of the People of the World? Is not every man a Friend and a profeſſed Lover to him that hath no need of their Friendſhip? O what <hi>greazing of fat Sows in the</hi> — is there frequently to be found through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole face of the Earth! but which is worſe, is not this vanity committed by ſuch as profeſs and make a great outward ſhew of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Chriſtianity? And yet to an Acquaintance, Aſſociate, a decayed Kinſman, better and more worthy both for Birth, Parts and Breeding then themſelves, do they extend any thing ſave a bundle of flattering words, and diſſembling Proteſtations of Love, affection and good will? and then aſſoon as their backs are turned, give it out, he is wicked, a ſwearer, a beggar, he lives by this and by that; here lies all his hope, and here his greateſt refuge; never remembring, <hi>It is an ill bird that defiles his own nest,</hi> rejoycing at the decay and poverty of them, that themſelves might be had in greateſt eſteem? Is not this a great evil? How many <hi>Ambodexters, Januſſes, Hypocrites,</hi> doth the world abound with, that are outwardly Lambs, yet inwardly Wolfs, that play Legerdemain, and practiſe nought elſe, <hi>Hocus Pocuſſes,</hi> ſeeming Saints, yet really Devils, that have excuſes for the greateſt ſins, nay for pride it ſelf which hurled <hi>Lucifer</hi> the great Angel of light, <hi>the great Carrier of light</hi> (as his name imports, being interpreted) headlong to <hi>Hell</hi> and eternal deſtruction? We know the Apoſtle to <hi>Timpothy,</hi> Tim. 1.2, 9, 10. exhorteth, <hi>that women adorn themſelves in modest apparel, with ſhamefastneſs and ſobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly aray; but (which becometh women profeſsing godlneſs) with good works.</hi> Whereby we clearly ſee good works (according to the intent of the HOLY GHOST) ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the attire of women (eſpecially ſuch as profeſs the Goſpel and Godlineſs) then ſuch vanities as are there expreſt, and many now adays aſſume above their rank and quality; leaſt (as the ſcope of theſe words intimates unto us) they become a ſhame and reproach to the Goſpel and purity thereof; and Chriſtianity be lightly eſteemed for their ſakes, and theſe their vain practiſes. I ſay, notwithſtanding all this, ſome who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much to the world of Holineſs and Religion, are ſo hypocritical (nay I may well ſay deviliſh) as to maintain openly the gorgious apparel of women, and their vanities in ſuch practiſes, <hi>To be a grace, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Goſpel;</hi> chooſing rather thus highly to ſin againſt GOD, and diſpleaſe him both in the maintenance of the act, and [which is worſe] the vindication thereof, then in the leaſt to reprehend it in their children, it diſpleaſe their fantaſtical, whimſical, hypocrital wives; but heap ſin upon ſin, that ſin might be hid from the eyes of the world, fearing more he cenſures of frail, deſpicable unworthy <hi>man,</hi> then the eternal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great, terrible omniſcient, omnipreſent and omnipotent GOD that will call one day all to account; that will not meaſure men by the outward appearance, but the inward teſtimonies of the Spirit; that will reckon for every idle word; much more for every vain action, and premeditated and ſtudied lyes and fallacies to cloak and cover our wickedneſs and deteſtable actions; What profit will theſe vain, fooliſh, mad things be unto us, whereof we ſhall one day be aſhamed? our lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fault on our Husbands, and ſaying he will have it ſo; or upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61337:13"/>our Wives, that ſhe will have it ſo; will not then excuſe us, will not then plead for us, will not then advantage us a ruſh, will not expiate our ſin, nor will not protect us from the puniſhment; <hi>This is alſo vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How do we ſuit with every occaſion, with every company? Do we not when we viſite the Religious, the Miniſters, attire our ſelves modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, put on our plain black gowns, hide our necks, breaſts, gorgets, with our ſcarfs, our curled locks and broidered hair with our hoods; ſit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely, talk of profeſſion, and of this body, and the other body, rather then want diſcourſe and occaſion to cry up our ſelves? and yet do we ſtudy ever the more ſanctity? Our SAVIOUR CHRIST teacheth us to know ſuch as are indeed his Servants by an infallible token, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Yea ſhall know them by their fruits; do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles?</hi> their outward pretences are not grounds ſufficient to convince us of their innocency; they may be thus in ſheeps cloathing, yet inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be alſo ravening wolves, as you ſee in the preceding verſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt needs reprehend ſuch as poſitively conclude men either good or bad, according to the report of the world of them, or their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretences; deviating from this Rule, this infallible Rule; for as it is raſhneſs in any to believe windy reports; ſo is it folly, and worſe then madneſs to be carried away or deluded with pretences, and ſeeming out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, without firſt ſeriouſly examining the truth of both; the want of this leſſon in wiſdom is the cauſe we run our ſelves into millions of Premunires, which but for brevitie ſake I might prove by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular recital of many; wherefore learn this, and thou ſhalt be an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Politician; for ſo ſhalt thou eaſily pluck off the mask of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, diſperſe the miſts of envy and reproaches, and free thy ſelf of many inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>What coveting is there of this <hi>Daily applauſe</hi> of the world? Do we not run here, and run there, viſit this, relieve publickly, and that to be ſeen of men, make gatherings to our own advantage; ſpeak to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for money, cloaths, and other neceſſaries, to relieve the neceſſitated, and do it in our own Names; be known to none we have it from any, but that it is our own goodneſs and liberality, and yet hide our faces from our own fleſh? Is this Charity? Is this Chriſtianity? Is this according to what we profeſſe? Will we part with ſix pence to one that is in the moſt extremity of neceſſity when we ſee they cannot ſhew it to the world, or think it will not be known? Do we not abound with theſe formalities, nay do we not rather ſwarm with them?</p>
            <p>How many men follow tradition and common cuſtom, rather then their own Judgements, Senſe or Reaſon?</p>
            <p>What greater madneſs, folly and vanity can there be, then to ſee So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciters, Clerks, Scriveners, be better rewarded for running of errands, writing of a Bill, or a Bond in a neat hand and flouriſhing Letters, and it may be neither true Engliſh nor Senſe in it, then a Scholar and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſon for teaching them wit: To ſee Huntſmen entertained, receive ſtipends, diſcourſed with, when Learning goes a Begging? A lying flattering Favourite, that is a meer outſide, get more in a year then a

A quondam Beggar, that was glad to do any thing for a meſs of Porridge or a ſcrap of Bread, flant it, and ride in his Coach, have the worſt of his Attendants better then the beſt of his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or any of his Predeceſſors? That was formerly a ſervant to every one, now Lord it over all? Gentlemen goon foot, Beggars ride on hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, prancing Steeds? Philoſophers, Schollars and ingenuous ſouls crouch to Clowns, illiterate Curmudgins for a meals meat, or a nights lodging? Cloaths eſteemed before Wit, Learning, and underſtanding? meer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides honoured, inſides ſlighted, not eſteemed or valued? Men to have their guts in their brains, and brains in their guts? To ſtrain at Gnats and ſwallow Camels? To skip over blocks, and ſtumble at ſtraws?

Thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Place, injoying poſſeſſions, though Idiots; be honoured, reverenced, applauded, eſteemed of, crouched to: when vertue, and the chiefeſt of endowments a mortal can poſſeſs, wanting preferment, and traſh riches, ſhall be diſreſpected and undervalued? Then to ſee riches make a man wiſe, ſolid, diſcreet, judicious and vertuous, though a natural Fool; and poverty to render all theſe, and the man that poſſeſſeth them, a Fool, a Coxcomb, an Aſs? Wiſe men degraded; Fools preferred to office? Orators and Judicious men to be ſilent; Fools and Idiots prate, and have all the talk, and reprehend others, of what they themſelves are juſtly to be reprehended? Men that have enough, make Vaſſals of themſelves to their Inferiours to get more? Diligently to ſcrape with the one hand money together, and to ſquander it away without care with the other? To be penny wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pound fooliſh? To buy ſhadows and neglect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? Then to ſee ſo much difference between words and deeds? Men rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul?</hi> Act all kinde of villany, and pretend to be Saints? The Fox preach? Vice correct ſin? The Pig play on the Organs? Blind men judge of Colours? A world in the <hi>Moon</hi> and other Planets? Hell and damnation in <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars?</hi> the Earth turn round and the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtand ſtill? A man to ſmile in your face, and cut your throat? Pretend one thing, do clean contrary? Neither ſpeak what they think, nor think what they ſpeak? To hear every one ſay he is your humble ſervant, yet ayms to be your inſulting Maſter? Cuckolds to be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wink at their wives abuſes, and make much of thoſe that Cornuted them? Women to wear the breeches, men made a Noſe of Wax? Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ride in Coaches, men draw them? The Cart before the Horſe? Men build Caſtles in the Ayr? Towers build Maſons? Men conquer King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and be ſubdued by their own Paſſions and Affections? Rule Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and millions of men, and be ruled themſelves by one Woman? Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer abroad, be a ſneaks at home? Men poſſeſſed with the <hi>Devil-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> turn themſelves into all ſhapes and forms? be Religious with the Religious: profane with the profane: a ſpend-thrift with the Prodigal; a Miſer with the Uſurer; fawn and wag their tongues, hats and hands, as a Dog doth his tayl; be furious like a Lyon: milde like a Lamb; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, diſpraiſe; domineer, crouch; vapour here, be baffled there; and what not, may it but advantage them ſix pence? Then to ſee men and women force their children to marry for Riches, Honour, this end and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61337:14"/>that, and compell them to reject and refuſe their loves to their utter ruine and deſtruction? Love is the bond of perfectneſs, and as it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth all ſins, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.12. ſo doth it alſo hide all faults; I dare not tranſgreſs on thy Patience to ſhew thee the excellency of Love, and the folly of Parents in this their extream vanity, ſince I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, I fear, too tedious, but deſire thee, ſince <hi>verbum ſapienti,</hi> to be content with this, and for that I deſire to haſten to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>Then to ſee women think themſelves better, or at leaſt equal, or as good as men? Men not equal nor ſo good, much leſs better then wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. A man to be <hi>Jack Jackſon</hi> in the Country, and Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> in the City? To live in a Chriſtian Commonwealth [or at leaſt ſo in pretence] and dare not believe a word a man ſpeaks? Every whiffling Mechanick, a Politician; Gentlemen, wiſe, and learned, Simpletons? Lyes, Plots and inventions to cozen be believed and credited; plain dealing, truth and honeſty ſuſpected, derided, and accounted weakneſs? The moſt rational, ſolid, ſober and moſt diſcreet of all Gods Creatures Man, become the moſt fickle, whimſical, ſimple and ridiculous? Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolute Apes? one while in a narrow brim'd hat, a long waſte, his breeches to his knees; Boots and Boot-hoſe-tops, and great gingling Spurs, their feet as long as their legs, or at leaſt full as long again as their foot naturally, as in the year 1645. and 1646. In 1648. and 1649. a broad brim'd hat, and no other muſt ſerve; our breeches muſt be long, even down to our ancles; Boots with the tops trailing on the ground, little Spurs that muſt not gingle in the leaſt. In 1650. and 1651. we tumble into ſhort breeches again: In 1652. and this preſent year 1653. we think it ridiculous to wear boots, but altogether ſhoos and ſtockins, turning down with a top as the French Lackies have uſed to go for theſe many years; one while we have too long curling locks on both ſides of our head! anon all the whole ſide muſt be of a length and ſhort behinde! Thus verifying the old Proverb that <hi>we</hi> Engliſh <hi>know not when a thing is well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have hinted but at theſe laſt ſeven or eight years for that theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities might be the better remembred by us, and to our ſhame called to minde; as alſo for that I account not the ſubject worthy of further reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of other foregoing years; beſides, I bluſh to think men ſhould be ſuch Weather-cocks, or rather Cox-combs, thus never to reſolve on a ſet habit: might I give my Judgement what habit is moſt becoming, I ſhould commend this we now uſe, ſaving that our ſhoes and fantaſtical ſtockins ſpeak us rather Skip-jacks, Whifflers or Anticks, then ſober and ſolid men: I would have Boots, if I might give my verdict, uſed in their ſtead: for the length of our Breeches they cannot in my opinion be mended, being moſt rationally made according to the length of our thigh, not hiding our legs as formerly, and our doublets are made of the exact length of our waſts: I am not ſo traditionally ſpirited as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Trunk-breeches, making our Buttocks as big as a Barrel, nor the other extream, made cloſe to our thighs like a pair of ſtockins, neither their doublets with the waſte juſt under our Arm-pits (contrary to our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61337:14"/>natural ſhape) and flanting skirts reaching down to the ſeat, whence it was ſaid of old, <hi>I will ſit on your skirts,</hi> when an injury was threatened; for truly in my opinion thus to beſot our ſelves, and overſhoot our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in following ſuch a monſtrous and Clowniſh habit, were to render our ſelves more ridiculous by far then we are already: great Bands and Cuffs, and a little narrow brim'd hat alſo, unleſs I could ſee any reaſon, comelineſs or profit in them, I can no wiſe commend.</p>
            <p>It were a vain thing in me thus to recite the ſeveral alterations and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the garbs of Women, ſince every day produceth a new Toy; wherefore I ſhall only name ſome of their darling-trifles, which are as dear unto them as their lives, and which they conſtantly obſerve and reſolve to keep, <hi>viz.</hi> Their embroidered, curled, powdered hair; their waſhings, paintings, waters and Pomatoes to their faces; and when they have done all, their ſeveral ſorts of patches, half-moons, ſtars, coach and horſes, round, triangled, quadrangled, pointed, little, great, long and ſhort: Vainly and fooliſhly hereby imagining to make themſelves hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer then <hi>GOD</hi> hath created them, or is willing they ſhould be, and chooſing rather to pleaſe themſelves then him; nay, though it be to the diſpleaſing of him they muſt and will do it, what care they; their face is their God; they look no further; they believe no other; they care for no more. And as touching their Attire, it would tire <hi>Hercules,</hi> nay <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which were far ſtronger then an hundred ſuch as am I to relate it; and truly were I able, yet have I not patience, there are ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſtinkards and flirts, ſneaking Mechanicks wives to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſhould I attempt, would turn my ſtomack to think of them, and then inſtead of Writing, I ſhould preſent thee with a foul Paper; yet theſe muſt be lapt in ſilk, they are no body if they have not a Silk-Mo-hair, Taffaty, Tabby Gown (nay but for ſhame they would have cloth of gold or ſilver, forgetting it is a ſhame for them to attempt the worſt of theſe) a ſcarlet, watchet, tabby petticoat, and that muſt be laced too, gentle-woman-like; thus multiplying garment upon gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the apparel exceeds the worth of the bearer by an hundred degrees. They muſt have theſe out-ſides, though their in-ſides be as bad as may be; though they are as dirty that they are not to be tonched with a pair of tongs; though their ſmocks coſt not ten groats apeece, nay, though they pinch their bellies, and have hardly bread to eat, yet they muſt have clothes, and that a thouſand times beyond their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Can any thing be more vain then this? Do not our Governours deſerve ſeverely and ſharply to be reprehended they look not into theſe abuſes and vanities, when we know not a Gentlewoman from a Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical flirt? <hi>Joan is as good as my Lady;</hi> there is no more difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in their cloaths, then is in the dark; all's one; except ſhe write Lady on her back, ſhe ſhall never be known in this Age: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for diſtinction ſake [if for no other] it is moſt requiſite (as I humbly conceive) it be looked into, and an order taken, ſo as that every <hi>Jack</hi> and <hi>Gillet</hi> may be known to be Tradeſmen, Serving-men, &amp;c. and not equal in habit with their Superiours, by many degrees, &amp; Gentlemen of quality; for now with them (becauſe they are not reprehended in this their vanity)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61337:15"/>
               <hi>all are counted fellows at foot-ball,</hi> to the ſhame and blemiſh of the glory of this Nation; It would be much better certainly if the <hi>Cobler would not go beyond his Last,</hi> and everyone go according to his rank.</p>
            <p>Again, what greater madneſs then to ſee Lords no Gentlemen, no Gentlemen Lords, no Lords Gentlemen? Serving-men able to buy out their Matters? Wiſe, ſober, ſolid and judicious Gentlemen be led away, gull'd, perſwaded to any thing by their Vaſſals, even againſt their own knowledge? Men to believe any reports whether good or bad, with or againſt their friends or foes, without the leaſt ſearch into the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Illiterates that can hardly ſpeak ſenſe, write or read, preach and teach others; learned, reverend, orthodox Divines ſilenced, or at leaſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded? Such as deſerve not only reprehenſion but ſevere chaſtiſement, to reprehend and teach others? Such as are guilty of folly, to laugh at folly? Of which number I muſt now needs rank my ſelf, and be ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious as account my ſelf the chief, or greateſt Fool, more deſerving to be laughed at then any other; wherefore I my ſelf may juſtly thus queſtion with my ſelf,</p>
            <p>Art thou not more ſullen, melancholy and mad then <hi>Saturn?</hi> More jovial, merry and temperate at another time then <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf? More fierce, cholerick, peeviſh, waſpiſh and angry then <hi>Mars?</hi> And again, more gentle, wanton, and fuller of ſport then <hi>Venus?</hi> More lofty, proud, ambitious then the <hi>Sun?</hi> More fickle, wavering, and unconſtant then the <hi>Moon?</hi> Good with the good, bad with the bad like <hi>Mercury?</hi> Ever in extreams, too merry or too ſad? How ſilly art thou to tell others of their being led away by fair words, and none ſo ſoon wrought on as thy ſelf? Condemn others for following Antick Faſhions, and none ſo ſoon run into them? Plead for wiſdom, act nought but folly? Cry down Duels and ſingle Combats, yet account it better not to live then live with an affront? Condemn Drinking, and ſtay a whole week in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern? To be ſo mad, as to tell mad-men of their faults? To expoſe thy ſelf to the cenſure of every fool by writing publickly, thereby loſing the happineſs of enjoying thy ſelf to thy ſelf? And to think the ſmiles and applauſes of ſome, can countervail the frowns and reproaches of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Art not thou ſilly? The greateſt Fool of all? Worſe then mad?</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, ſhould I anſwer for my ſelf, I could not in the way of excuſe plead one word in my own behalf; I muſt acknowledge my ſelf guilty, and can ſay nothing but this, that it is a mad world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be worſe then mad, ſhould I think my ſelf other then mad. Yet leſs ſome conceited youngſter imagine himſelf more then he is, I muſt turn him to <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.12. and then let him be ſo mad, as to caſt the firſt ſtone at me, whence I may conclude all are mad, or at leaſt fools, we being ſo generally guilty hereof; but I ſhall name the words of the Text, that you may the better judge of it, <hi>Seest thou a man wiſe in his own conceit, there is more hope of a fool then of him.</hi> Now I would fain know, if one ſhould ſtrictly examine who is not guilty hereof, whether he ſhould finde any that is free: In former time there were but ſeven Wiſemen; now adays there is hardly ſo many Fools. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all fools, all
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61337:15"/>vain, all mad, mad, mad for company; <hi>This is the world, other's the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a general character of the world or an hint thereof, being altogether unable to paint it out to the life, yet what hath been ſaid [being ſo obvious to the ſenſe of every capacity] is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove it altogether vanity. And now I might alſo here fitly give you the deſcription of the Courts and Palaces of Kings, Inns of Courts, or the practiſes of Lawyers, and of Markets; but I fear then I ſhould be inexcuſably guilty of prolixity. Wherefore of each of theſe I ſhall only give thee a touch, and haſten to conclude.</p>

               <note place="margin">Inſtructions how to chooſe a friend.</note>In chooſing then of Friends; firſt negatively, and then affirmatively I ſhall deſire thee to obſerve theſe Rules: Negatively, that by no means
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61337:16"/>you familiarly aſſociate your ſelf with a lyar, diſſembler or a flatterer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a proud man, nor covetous perſon; for they will prove deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, treacherous and ſelf-ended; beware alſo of Bragadotia's; I mean ſuch as boaſt and glory of their charity or courteſie to others, that they have done this good turn, and the other good turn for them; for though it be true they have been beneficial to ſuch, and that they have done all that they brag of, yet will ſuch [take it for an approved maxime] be never true-hearted unto thee: And ſuch as are ſo baſe as to deſire or beg that which they ſee is precious and deer in the ſight of any one, are alſo to be ſhunned, with thoſe that are not able to keep ſecret what is committed to them in Truſt, and Promiſe-breakers, and ſuch as meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem of thee for thy Riches; for theſe although they carry a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or outward gloſs of Friendſhip unto thee, yet are they never cordial and real Friends, but fained outſides. But on the other ſide let ſuch be deer unto thee, and choſen for thy friends and familiars that are honeſt and prudent, and as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, whoſe integrity, conſtancy, fidelity and liberality is known to all their acquaintance: Let him that is zealouſly affected with and to vertuous and religious acts, be thy aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and choice companion; for as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, friendſhip was given by nature to Mankind to help us and further us to vertuous inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to vitious, lewd and ſordid practices: wherefore <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellently ſaid, if we would ſhun vice we muſt be familiar but with few; and <hi>Dicearchus</hi> would intimate the ſame unto us, when he adviſeth us to make the vertuous only our Friends, if we deſire to keep the name of vertuous and honeſt men, and the reſt of the world, if poſſible, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers unto us; wherefore wiſe <hi>Bias</hi> very wiſely ſaid, He was not wiſe that would make every one his Familiar; whence I may alſo conclude, that in the multitude of friendſhip is friendſhip violated. Do not exceed then in abundance of friends and acquaintance; for if thou haſt but a few honeſt men and real friends to be thy friends, thou mayſt be aſſured thou doſt exceedingly abound in friends.</p>

               <note place="margin">Caveats in chooſing of friends.</note>And now that thou mayſt not be an enemy to thy ſelf in this thy choice, let me here give thee one or two Memorandums. Firſt, that you let not common applauſe or reproach be a rule or ground to your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or diſ-eſteem of any one; but firſt ſeriouſly examine the truth, and then accordingly mayſt thou uſe thy diſcretion and reaſon: Secondly, let not the Nation of a man deter thee from real affection, if there be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe and ground to the contrary; for it were abſurd in us to think all Nations evil, and our ſelves only good: As there are both good and bad amongſt us, ſo is there alſo in the very ruraleſt of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; what reaſon have we to think all the Iriſh blood-thirſty, all the Scots deceitfull, all the French fantaſtical, &amp;c. becauſe many of them are ſo? For my part, if I meet with any man of theſe that is true-hearted and honeſt, or of any other Nation, they ſhall be more deer unto me then a thouſand Engliſh Knaves; and as I will not conclude any man of another Nation a Knave or Honeſt, till I have experience thereof, ſo will I not be ſo indulgent as to make no queſtion of thoſe of my own Nation,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61337:17"/>but carry a like ſuſpition of both the one and the other, till I am rightly and truly informed: The <hi>Scots</hi> are vulgarly amongſt us traduced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed, and yet they cannot be ſo odious here, but amongſt them we are as contemptible; Tradition carries a great ſway with fools and the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, but with wiſe men it is never regarded. Thirdly, let not the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel or cloaths of any one ſtave thee off from the familiar ſociety of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; it is not the Peacocks fine feathers, that can make him ſing like a Nightingal: a Philoſopher may be in rags, when an Idiot is gorgeouſly arrayed; look not to the outſide, but the inſide rather of a man, and thou ſhalt not be deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How to know a true friend.</note>Now to know the reality of thy friend, or whether thou haſt a true friend or no; ſee that in your tryal of him, you let him not know your condition, let it be in what degree or thing ſoever you prove him in; it would be too tedious a thing for me to ſpeak of every thing and way whereby thou mayſt try him, wherefore I ſhall here only inſtance one, by which according to the ſame method thou mayſt judge of the reſt. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you would borrow money, then be ſure firſt you want not money, leſt if your friend fail you, you are expoſed to want and ſorrow; yet be not known upon any condition to him you are or can be ſupplied, leſt then on the other ſide, he knowing your ability, readily performs your requeſt, and you thereby kept ſtill ignorant of his affection; for take this for a ſure Rule, that that, and that only is real love, that without regard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital or conſideration at all thereunto, ſets it ſelf on work, let it be in this or any other kinde whatſoever; wherefore if thou haſt found ſuch a Friend as this, thou haſt aſſuredly a faithfull and real Friend indeed: never believe the fair pretences and promiſes of men, neither their allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tongues and ſmooth ſpeeches, which commonly are the properties of diſſemblers and falſe-hearted, or hollow-hearted people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for you ſhall ſeldom ſee a fair tongue and a diſſembling heart go aſunder; wherefore if any ſuch thou findeſt, thou haſt more matter of ſuſpition then credit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee. But remember that in proving of thy Friend thou render not thy ſelf ſo unfriendly to him, as to require any unlawfull thing at his hand; for then aſſuredly thou muſt not only expect a denial of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent requeſt from thy friend, but the future friendſhip of thy Friend hereafter.</p>

               <note place="margin">How to keep a true friend.</note> That thou mayſt now keep a true Friend when thou haſt found him, it is requiſite (as I have promiſed) to give thee ſome Rules. Wherefore then let your patience be reciprocal, your opinions mutual, your love in all matters (eſpecially things of indifferency) free, let your love be for love, not recompence or gain. And for that, <hi>Nemo ſine crimine vivit,</hi> there is none without a fault; you are to hide them, and to wink at them in one another, provided they proceed from frailty and imbecility of Nature; and when you admoniſh or reprehend a friend, let it be in a place and at a time convenient; not openly in company, but privately between you and him, otherways you will harden him in his way, and work no good on him; not when he or thy ſelf is in paſſion, for this will cauſe thy words to be lightly eſteemed, and work no impreſſion on him: And let thy ſpeech be gentle and mild, yet be plain with him, and ſpeak
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61337:17"/>to the purpoſe, overcome him rather with mildneſs and clemency then anger and rigour, by which he will be conſtrained rather to adhere unto thee and acknowledge himſelf obliged for this favour, then remain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and wilfull.</p>
            <p>But let me now returne to ſhew thee the method of theſe my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Labours.

Tom. 2. <hi>Pigmei gigantum humeris impoſiti pluſquam ipſi gigantes vident.</hi> Dwarfs or Pigmies ſtanding upon the ſhoulders of Giants, may ſee farther then thoſe Giants: I would have none therefore wonder to ſee me frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſent from the Ancients and relate my own conceptions in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places; yet in moſt I follow my Authors, at leaſt in ſenſe, though not <hi>verbatim.</hi> And in ſome places I have trod the very ignorant and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational paths of the Ancients, that ſo the ingenious and wel-willer to this Science may have matter wherewith to exerciſe himſelf, and not wholly to give himſelf over to traditional precepts; for my own part I abhor implicite Faith, or erroneous tradition, without ſound and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon given for it; and therefore you will find I have often in theſe my labours diſſented from my Predeceſſors. By ſome perhaps I ſhall be diſcommended, and again by others applauded for it; it is an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pleaſe all parties, and therefore I have (I ſay) let ſlip ſome places, on purpoſe to convince thee that former Ages had not all the knowledge in the World, that ſo thou mayſt be weaned from thy confidence in the writings of the Ancients when neither reaſon nor experience are on their ſide; I ſhall not need to turn you to any of thoſe places in this Book; I hope your ingenuity will be a ſufficient index thereunto: yet leaſt ſome <hi>Momus</hi> ſhould convert this my ſilence to ignorance, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to wound me with my own weapon, by imputing that as a fault in me, which I did wilfully neglect, I ſhall here mention one place, being ſo remarkable and ſo palpable an abſurdity,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Bonatus de Revolutionibus,</hi> cap. 95.</note>

            <p>It had been too intricate a thing for me to have noted where I have in any place inlarged of my own, ſince it is ſo general throughout all the four Books; yet my phraſe and ſtile will lead thee I believe unto moſt of it; it is wholly my own method and no tranſlation, but rather a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, ſo that I may well ſay with <hi>Macrobius, Omne meum nihil meum;</hi> mine is none of mine: yet this I can aſſure thee, that I do not remember any point or place where I have willingly been dark, or deſired to detain any thing from thy underſtanding: It is, as I may ſay, even hewed out of the Rocks, and therefore I expect ſome places may be rougher and more unpoliſhed then I could wiſh; it is the firſt draught, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope that may a little plead for me; wherefore be pleaſed (Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader) to accept of my wel-wiſhes, and out of thine own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gratefull diſpoſition pardon my defects, which I cannot but fear are many, having not had time to correct it, or alter the ſtile or phraſe, which at the beſt is but homely, and ſometimes very harſh, according to the preſent condition and fancy of my genius at times, not at all ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to frame or place my words, but <hi>quicquid in buccam venit</hi> ſerved turn; and to tell you the truth, it being once brought forth, I could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to think of correcting it, it being a work both ſo painfull and troubleſom, ſo that I had rather write another Book as big again, and could as ſoon accompliſh it, as correct what I have here written; beſides, ſhould I have gone about it, as oft as I ſhould have read it, ſo often ſhould I have altered it in one kind or other, according to that of <hi>Ter.

            <p>But to theſe men I ſay, let them ſorrow and repent themſelves of their hypocriſie, ſelf-endedneſs, pride and coveteouſneſs the root of all evil, and learn love, humility, charity, and to purchaſe unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves general ſpirits; I know the conſciences of ſome of them will teſtifie unto themſelves they are herein ſpoken to, and preſently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I ſpeak in ill will to them, being conſcious to themſelves they have given me ſufficient cauſe by their frequent diſparagements of me to ſome of my acquaintance.</p>
            <p>But I appeal to an higher power to be Judge of this my action, I do not envy or bear ill will to any of their perſons, but I cannot endure to have men pretend to promote an Art or any thing elſe, and yet in the mean time act nothing leſs, nor nothing more then the ingroſsing of it wholly to themſelves: it is this, and this only that cauſeth me in any place to hint at them; wherefore ſince I know my own innocency herein, I ſhall be content to let them rail and revile me at their pleaſure.</p>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Aſtronomie</hi> is a Science by which not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things but what is paſt and to come may be known.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee here what difference the Antients have made betwixt the one part and the other; and he in that ſame chapter further ſheweth how they differ, where he ſaith, <hi>In quo differunt iſtae duae partes dicam tibi,</hi> in what theſe two parts differ I ſhall ſhew thee; and ſo forward; wherefore then this being apparently manifeſt, I ſhall not here ſpend more time or trouble thee, referring thee for further ſatisfaction to his twelfe chapter, where he ſheweth cleerly both the parts and ſpecies of <hi>Aſtronomie;</hi> and I believe an artificer is beſt able to deliver a definition of his own Art, and rather to be believed then one altogether ignorant therein, which that man muſt needs be, that will be ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily baſe and impudent, or rather imprudent, as to deny what is thus confeſſed by all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Authentick writers of this heavenly and moſt delectable and admired Science; neither upon due conſideration will any man finde the knowledge of the motions,<note place="margin">

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61337:25"/>would have taught us accordingly, and alſo have directed the precepts of the Art to have dependency on the place of the Heavens at the Creation, which were as far removed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time as they have been ſince ; ſo that ſince the firſt Creation of all things, <hi>Aries the firſt ſign</hi> (and ſo conſequently uniformly all the reſt in that Starry Sphear) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and revolved in the courſe of its motion neer upon three whole ſigns, according to <hi>Ticho</hi> his Account, which if this were of any, or the leaſt moment (as I have ſaid) we ſhould never poſſibly be able (having no regard thereunto) to foretell any thing with certainty; But our Rules run on another ſtrain (as hath been ſaid) <hi>viz.</hi> a Planet in ſuch a Sign, ſignifieth ſo and ſo, let it be by its revolution where it will, &amp;c. But this we finde daily certain, and the other conſequently then of no efficacy; as for example.</p>
                     <p>We ſee clearly, and that to be teſtified by every vulgar notion, that when the <hi>Sun</hi> comes into the Equinoctial point of <hi>Aries,</hi> the Spring forthwith begins to ſhew it ſelf;<note place="margin">The aforeſaid objection cleared by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> every thing by its humidity and temperate heat, being thereby made to flouriſh, and as it were to riſe again from the dead, which have by the tedious blaſts of the Hyemnal Ayr been kept in obſcurity; and this without reſpect to the place where <hi>Aries</hi> was in <hi>Ptolomies</hi> time, or at the firſt Creation; which neither then at that time had any other but the ſame efficacy now they have, though they may be intended or remitted by the conjunctions and configurations of the Planets, or by the variation of their declination, as they dart their beams more or leſs down perpendicularly upon us, and ſo work more or leſs powerfully at one time then another in the ſame place.</p>

                     <p>Wherefore then ſince it is ſo, of neceſſity there muſt much inconveniency and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief come thereby, both to the ignorant themſelves and others; I forbear here (for brevitie ſake) to ſhew you the prodigious and wofull effects of ignorance in ſome of former ages as well as in this wherein we live; this is already clear to all judicious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious ſouls: wherefore to our purpoſe, I ſay there are in this perverſe age, many ſticklers (or ſo in pretence) againſt this Liberal and moſt divine Science, one whereof (for the undeceiving of my Reader, having publiſhed a pretended Reply to my Anſwer to Doctor <hi>Homes</hi>) I ſhall (craving pardon for my tediouſneſs) here take notice of, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be not worthy of the ſame, as you your ſelf ſhall judge, when you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed what follows; for, both his quality, and<note n="*" place="margin">For I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed he is an Hay-maker, Plaſter maker, Chyrurgion, Quack-ſalver, and Tub Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or at leaſt after he hath been all theſe, he ayms at the Preaching of the Goſpel; but I will adviſe him firſt to get a good and true tongue in in his head.</note> variety of profeſſions, as alſo rural beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and diſpoſition, in whoſe name it is publiſhed, ſpeaketh him not worthy the naming or anſwering, as I would have done had it been otherwiſe and better fathered, that the errours and abſurdities of that railing Pamphlet might have been divulged to the world.

                     <p>Thirdly, for that it was not worthy of the Authors owning, or elſe he was aſhamed of it, or he had never ſent it abroad in another mans name; for let whoſe name will be at the end of the Epiſtle to the Reader, it is well known by Mr <hi>Daniel</hi> the Printer in <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſter-row,</hi> and the then Compoſers and Preſſe-men, that Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> was the Author of it, and not onely payed for the printing, but alſo Corrected every day at the Preſs; and let him deny if he can his peeviſhneſs with the Preſſe-men, when they were angry he came not to Correct, and made them all that afternoon ſtand idle. For it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that a Hay-maker (as it is very well known the owner thereof, or he under whoſe name it was publiſhed, was but two or three yeers ſince) ſhould be able to hold an Argument againſt one of the Liberal Sciences, although his ignorance might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it.</p>
                     <p>But truly I cannot but commend the policy of the Doctor herein, who knowing the inſufficiency of his brat to refell the Arguments in my Anſwer to his firſt diſcourſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loth to be ſeen bafled the ſecond time in Print, for a piece of mony knew how to make another father it; and truly therein he alſo did a very charitable deed; for of all ſneaks that ever I ſaw in my life (that pretended to any thing) was this poor fellow he got to be the father of this Rable; for hearing he lay at the Bell in <hi>Carter</hi>-lane, I went purpoſely to confer with him touching ſome paſſages of that book which went under his name, but could not meet with him, whereupon I left a note, deſiring him to do me the favour if it were he that owned ſuch a book (for I was unacquainted with him) to let me know, (or whether it might be ſome other of his name) and he ſhould oblige me therein, and for an anſwer thereunto, I would be there again the next day at eleven of the clock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>To this purpoſe (I ſay) I writ a note and left it with the Chamberlain of the aforeſaid Inn, and deſired that he would importune him for an anſwer; he promiſed me he would, and ſo for that time I departed, came the next day according to promiſe, inquired for the Chamberlain, demanded an anſwer, who had no more for me then this, that he had delivered my note, and importuned an anſwer, but could receive none; then I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chamberlain with the buſineſs, that there was a Book publiſhed in the name of ſuch a one, and being informed it was him that lay there, that owned it, and therefore I deſired him in my note to let me receive that favour from him to know whether he was the man, or ſome other of his name, and ſo wiſhed him to acquaint him again with my being there at the time appointed, and wondred he would refuſe to do ſo ſmall a favour as to reſolve me in ſuch a queſtion, I or no; which he again promiſed me he would.</p>

                     <p>But both he and the Antient Doctor his Maſter, and Author of that wiſe word (who confeſſed (to a friend of mine) <hi>nothing vexed him, but that he was anſwered by ſo young a man</hi>) muſt know that neither wiſdom, learning, knowledge, nor grace is to be meaſured by the Beard or age, and therefore but a moſt weak evaſion in his Arguments, of the validity and verity of <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> neither is it any extraordinary witty quibble,

                     <p>And ſuch is his malice, he cannot be content with this, but upon my expreſſion of the <hi>Bleſſed ſtone of the Philoſophers</hi> which was but brought in by the way, he quibbles on it, (leaving the matter ſtill in queſtion, and his Reader unſatisfied) and that with invective, malicious, ſlanderous ſpeeches againſt my father, inferring by his rabble in the 39 page thereof, that my father was not onely ruined by his ſtudy in that matter, but alſo lay in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereby, which is moſt notoriouſly falſe, as all that are of his acquaintance can juſtifie, for that he neither is in priſon or ever was upon any ſuch ſcore; there is nothing more certain. It is true, much he hath expended in trying concluſions that way, but I defie any man living to ſay he put him to a peny charges therein; but ſo intolerable is his further abuſe herein, that I cannot but deliver it to the world, both for the clearing of my father and manifeſting this Furioſo's maliciouſneſs; in the ſame place he hath theſe words, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting thus in his wicked ſtanders; and truly for this had he his due, his ears ſhould be cropt to teach him to keep his tongue within compaſs; after he had mentioned moſt falſly and unworthily, he was in priſon thereby, he ſaith, <hi>though the late King bore with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating him of his expectations, and of ſcores of pounds, yet other men will not, cannot bear ſuch wrongs;</hi> intimating as will ſoon appear to the judicious Reader, that he had mony from the King for his charges in thoſe works, but to his great dammage brought naught to paſs, which of all miſchiefs and envies, is the greateſt; for there is none who had any acquaintance with the King, but can acquaint the world, he was ever averſe to ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and had many times diſſwaded him from ſuch expenſive courſes (this truly is a pretty world when ſuch fellows as he ſhall ſpeak of kings actions and expectations) and ſo far was he from lending him mony, that he owed him in arrear when he died, 5500. l. as is teſtified under the hands of Sir <hi>Robert Pye,</hi> Sir <hi>William Vuidale,</hi> Sir <hi>David Cunningham,</hi> Cap. <hi>Falkonbridge,</hi> Auditor <hi>Collins</hi> and others; but certainly he that will preſume in print thus to affirm untruths, and thoſe ſo ſcandalous, will not ſtick to ſay any thing, right or wrong, ſo he may but advantage himſelf ſixpence.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore what he ſaith in deriſion of that moſt ſublime Revelation and heavenly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which men vulgarly call <hi>the Philoſophers Stone,</hi> but in effect the <hi>ſoul of the world,</hi> and that whereby all things both Coeleſtial and Terreſtial that are creatures, ſubſiſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and next under God himſelfe, have their being; I ſay whatever he or any ſuch Animal to whom God hath not beſtowed ſo much mercy, as to believe ſuch a thing to be in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> or <hi>in poſſe,</hi> ſaith againſt it, is not much material; for my part, if I ſhould ſee ſuch kind of creatures believe and diſcourſe thereon, I ſhould (had I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard thereof) have concluded it to be meer foolery, and madneſs, as theſe mad kind of people do;<note n="*" place="margin">A good jeſt, were it not too tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</note> but if I ſhould ask him what he thinks of Coining, I believe he would conclude that a great deal the better Trade; but I ſhall paſs by that, for <hi>he knows well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough what I mean,</hi> Ile warrant you, he thinks his a more <hi>bleſſed</hi> thing a great deal.</p>
                     <p>Again ſecondly, in his 43 page he ſaith, <hi>I was ſet on by my Brethren the Aſtrologers (being one of the ſilly weak ones)</hi> to confute Doctor <hi>Homes;</hi> and in divers places he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms and aſſures his Reader, <hi>I ſtudy and practice the Art in a mercenary way, and gain mony by reſolving queſtions;</hi> whereby you may plainly ſee how his envy runs him into an abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inſtead of ſpeaking ſenſe, he committeth nonſenſe, and rendreth himſelf ridiculous

                     </p>
                     <p>All this thou mayeſt clearly ſee in my <hi>Lux Veritatis;</hi> and but for tediouſneſs, I might rehearſe yet ſome other paſſages in Page 65. line 15. pag 70. l. 17. p. 75. l. 11. p. 85. l. 17. p. 97. l. 28. p. 94. p. 90. l. 29. &amp;c. But by what hath been already ſaid, thou mayſt ſee their palpable malice and envy, as alſo their intolerable abuſes and untruths; for you ſee they care not what they ſay or affirm, ſo it may be but to their advantage, or what they rail out ſo to the diſparagement of thoſe that pleaſe them not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Both the Dr. and his man by their own words convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their cauſe, and therefore other teſtimonies are needleſs, &amp;c.</note>Wherefore now Reader do thou judge, and tell me (all this being conſidered) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their own words <hi>(It is to prudent men the ſign of a bad cauſe, that needs to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by bad words)</hi> their cauſe be to be judged or accounted good, who have ſo often been guilty thereof, and that moſt maliciouſly, in both inventing and affirming detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moſt abuſive ſpeeches and ſtories: and whether their cauſe then be not only bad, but the baddeſt and worſt of cauſes, who in all that rabble of their pretended Reply have hardly one page wherein there is not ſome abuſe, foul language or an untruth.</p>
                     <p>Now as touching their evaſions, I ſhall briefly run over two or three of them that ſo they may be known for Sophiſters, and then proceed; for it would be folly in me to take notice of more. In the firſt page of my diſcourſe I ſhew the Reader, the Doctor in all his Book declares not what Aſtrologie is he ſo ſtrives to beat down; and therefore for their better underſtanding of what we ſo <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> maintain, I there delivered a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, which I gathered from the 1. chap. and 1. book of <hi>Ptolomies Quadripartite,</hi> the which, ſay they, is not in that place, nor any other ſet down by him, after they had as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61337:35"/>you have heard, gone on in their invective railings and abuſes to make me odious, and then by this their weak evaſion they indeavour to give an inlet to all their abſurdities, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed muſt needs conſequently follow, if this be admitted.</p>
                     <p>But admit that definition was never recorded by him or any other <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> yet are they never the neerer to their purpoſe; for, if I may (that am to vindicate the Art) have liberty to tell them what it is that I ſtand for and maintain, ſince they have not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew what it is they condemn; why then, I ſay, I define <hi>Aſtrologie to be that Art, which by the conſtant motions, configurations, and Influences of the Stars and Planets,</hi>

                     <p>But this is not all; Who ſo ſhall but take the pains to compare my diſcourſe with their pretended Reply (although they pretend to the Reader they ſet down my chapters and ſections <hi>verbatim</hi>) will ſoon finde their Sophiſtical juggles, and the Reader deceived; for they not only omit here and there ſomewhat, which maketh abſolutely againſt them, but alſo in moſt ſections and chapters there is ſome very conſiderable points eſcaped their notice, for that they had diſparaged themſelves to have expreſſed them, knowing they could not give any ſolid or ſober Reply thereunto, I ſhall here only mention one whole ſection they have omitted, referring the reſt to your own ſearch at your leiſure; for it were an intricate and too tedious a thing in this Book to particularize every one, and the reaſons why they omitted them; ſince, I ſay they have been herein ſo generally guilty, and not only ſo, but alſo in many places of what they have ſet down thou wilt finde they have clearly wreſted the ſenſe and meaning of my words, and made them conformable to their own intentions, the better to have liberty for their bald jeers, abuſes and ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: wherefore ſhould I take notice of ſuch ſhufflers ſo as to trouble my ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them an anſwer, according to that of the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4.

                     <p>And as touching <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.3. in their 22. page, where they ſhould have proved it no ways available to my Argument or purpoſe, diſputants like, alas, they tell their Reader, <hi>my interpretation muſt give place to the Apoſtles,</hi> Rom. 10.18. viz. <hi>preaching of the Goſpel, not of Aſtrologie; and for the Pleiades in</hi> Job, ſay they, <hi>they are anſwered after; and for the fighting of the ſtars againſt</hi> Siſera, compare <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Exod</hi> 9.23. but name the words of none of theſe places; for that would diſcover their wickedneſs in wreſting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by affirming what is not; as alſo their ignorance and weakneſs in not knowing how otherwiſe to anſwer the buſineſs, but by quoting the like number of Texts, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Reader, therein he ſhall receive clear ſatisfaction, never regarding whether they were any thing or not to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>But ſince ye are ſo cunning, I will be as cunning as you; and ſince the point is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, as that the legality of the Art, and the warrant thereof from Divine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture dependeth thereon, I ſhall ſhew you (becauſe you have thus played the Sophiſters with your Reader in this as in all other) what thoſe paſſages you quote ſpeak, and then let any that hath but half an eye to diſcern between light and darkneſs, good and bad, truth and falſhood, judge of the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>But firſt, let me ſhew you what they have unawares confeſſed touching that of Judges, thinking it will confirm that ridiculous aſſertion of theirs, <hi>That the meaning of that Text is, the ſtorms, Tempeſts, winde and rain fought againſt</hi> Siſera: Ha, ha, he! I never knew in my life (nor (I am confident) the antienteſt and wiſeſt Philoſopher that ever was) any ſtar that had the name of ſtorm, tempeſt, wind, rain or hail; the Divine Writ expreſly telleth us, that <hi>the ſtars in their courſes fought, &amp;c.</hi> and yet theſe —, what ſhall I call them, <hi>render</hi> it ſtorms, tempeſts, wind, &amp;c. and therein themſelves both envious and ridiculous, having no better a come off; if all their learning cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>ſtars</hi> and <hi>ſtorms,</hi> they are not ſo fit to hold or maintain an Argument, as to go to ſchool to learn to ſpell better; for although they are ſo antient, <hi>nunquam ſera eſt,</hi> &amp;c. for (no diſparagement to them) I have known wiſer, nay and far more ſolid and diſcreet at 18. yeers of age; but perhaps this their errour proceeded not from any defect of Judgement, but of old Age and wanting their ſpectacles miſtook &amp; read <hi>ſtorms</hi> for <hi>ſtars,</hi> as their quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam brother read <hi>green-bay-horſe</hi> for <hi>bay-tree;</hi> wherefore ſince they are in their dotage, or at leaſt ſince theſe and ſuch like miſtakes are uſual with them, I ſhall not farther take notice of ſuch animals; but return to ſhew you what a rod they have given me to whip themſelves, which they had very well deſerved, had they been thus tardy at School.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Their Reply to <hi>Iob.</hi> 38.31.</note> but they tell him not in what manner; for if they had, they had been unwiſe; for all the anſwer that I could find in all their Galimaufry was only this, <hi>that what I ſaid was falſe,</hi> according to the old ſaying, <hi>in a word thou lyeſt;</hi> a pure way to confute an Argument, and very eaſie! But whoſo ſhall peruſe St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon <hi>Iob,</hi> which here would be too tedious to diſcuſs, and in a manner (being ſo clear, and that by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſo good an Author) ſuperfluous; I ſay no more on this matter, only deſiring thee alſo to peruſe but the preceding and ſubſequent words of that paſſage of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> which they bring, ſeeming to make for them, and thou ſhalt finde therein alſo their jugling tricks to deceive their Reader: juſt as they brought <hi>Ptolomie</hi> to condemn <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> which I hinted at in the beginning of this Book; for it is very ſtrange that <hi>Ptolomie</hi> ſhould ſpeak againſt that which he taught to the World in four Books in Folio; but if the ſenſe and meaning of the Author be not regarded, it is an eaſie matter even in the beſt of Writings to finde out ſome ſeeming contradictions.</p>
                     <p>But I dare poſitively affirm and maintain that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth in no place of all his works condemn, and poſitively diſ-allow of <hi>Chriſtian Iudicial Aſtrologie</hi> in its purity, and not abuſed; and this may ſufficiently be manifeſted by thoſe five opinions I have ſet down in my <hi>Lux Veritatis,</hi> chap. 2. ſect. 3. which he recordeth <hi>in libro de Civitate Dei,</hi> lib. 5. cap. 1. for though the ſuperſtitious abuſes thereof be by him condemned, it argueth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the natural uſes are to be aboliſhed; and therefore though before his converſion he followed the Hereſies of the <hi>Manichees,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 4. and lib. 20. cap. 6. <hi>contra Fauſtum Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheum.</hi>
                        </note> who maintained the ſtars to be adored and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and afterwards wrote againſt them, yet can it not be made apparent, that he utterly condemned this liberal Science, as will appear by theſe words of his in <hi>libro</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>de Civitate Dei; Non uſque quaque abſurde dici poſſit ad ſolas corporum differentias, afflatus quoſdam valere ſidereos, ſient in ſolaribus acceſſibus, &amp; receſſibus; videmus etiam ipſius anni tempera variari, &amp; lunaribus incrementis &amp; decrementis angeri &amp; minni quaedam genera rerum, ſicut echinos &amp; conchas, &amp; mirabiles aeſtus oceani, non autem &amp; animi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntates poſitionibus ſyderum ſubdi:</hi> whereby we ſee nothing exempted from ſubjection to the ſtars that is bodily, but only our ſpiritual part; neither doth he aſcribe this power to the ſtars in general, as that their ſpecifical vertues are not poſſible to be known by man; for in his Book <hi>De gen. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap</hi> 5. he agreeth with <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> that <hi>Saturn</hi> is cold.</p>
                     <p>Again ſhall we admit that St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and with him all the Fathers unanimouſly are againſt <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> yet may we not hence make our ſelves ſo ridiculous as to conclude <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> of no validity or efficacy, they being but men, and therefore ſubject to error; and ſince it is nowiſe condemned by the word of God (which ſhould be the touchſtone of all mens writings) further then that men ſhould not give the power of the Creator to the creature, nor impoſe a fatal neceſſity and truſt therein; and therefore St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the aforeſaid fifth Book, and firſt chap. of <hi>his City of God,</hi> delivering five opinions (as I ſaid) concerning deſtiny, in his firſt ſheweth, that by deſtiny is underſtood <hi>The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, will, and power of God;</hi> and therefore he warneth Aſtrologers, <hi>that they continue their opinions, but correct their tongues;</hi> for that through cuſtom of ſpeech the vulgar commonly underſtood nothing by the word <hi>fate,</hi> or <hi>deſtiny,</hi> but <hi>the inevitable power of the ſtars;</hi> and ſo becomes a means to draw them from a true truſt and confidence in God and his word.</p>
                     <p>And truly were it not for fear of making this Treatiſe too great, I could ſhew you that every part of <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> nay even monethly Prognoſtications (which ſome men think are condemned by the word of God) being grounded upon obſervation deduced from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61337:38"/>cauſes in nature, have ever been permitted and ſuffered in all well ordered and Chriſtian Common-wealths; and that not only the Fathers and latter Divines, but even Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> himſelf <hi>in his admonition,</hi> with others (that attribute as little to this Art as they may) do allow thereof, <hi>ſo far forth as it extends to the ſtate of the weather, of health, ſickneſs, plenty, dearth, and to the direction of the Phyſitian when to purge by Pill, when by Potion, when by letting of blood;</hi> this being as far as I maintain the Art, and make my ſtudy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in proceed, as ſhall be cleared before the cloſure of this Treatiſe; but let us here proceed.</p>

Kings? for by their own confeſſion, the ſtorms, hale, wind, and tempeſts that diſcomfited <hi>Siſeras</hi> Army, were occaſioned by the influence of the ſtars; and therefore I know no reaſon to the contrary, but that they were alſo occaſioners of theſe hale-ſtones, ſo that they have gained little by this their firſt place to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with compared.</p>
                     <p>As touching the ſecond, it is this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.23. The words are, <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſtretched forth his Rod towards Heaven, and the Lord ſent thunder and hale, and the fire run along upon the ground, and the Lord rained hale upon the Land of</hi> Egypt; a ſtrong argument truly, that the ſtars in their courſes fought not againſt <hi>Siſera!</hi> what would they have it to be, or their Reader to underſtand by theſe their weak come-offs? would they have it the hand of God? I ſay the ſame; would they have it hale-ſtorms? I ſay ſo to; what would they have it to be? Can they ſhew me in either, or both theſe their texts, that the ſtars in their courſes fought not againſt <hi>Siſera?</hi> or can they ſhew that thereby we are taught and ſhewn to read that place otherwiſe? but they muſt know this, that though in neither of them there is a word to be found or mention made of any ſtars, yet in that of Judges there is both mention of them, and expreſs teſtimony they fought againſt <hi>Siſera, The ſtars in their courſes fought againſt</hi> Siſera.</p>
                     <p>So that you ſee clearly my Arguments, proving Aſtrologie to be warranted by the word of God, do remain yet unſhaken, and that notwithſtanding all that they have or can ſay; no ſolid Reply can be by them produced to the contrary; wherefore it mattereth not (ſhould we make no more words) what either of them both or all the men in the World that are either ignorantly or obſtinatly or traditionally againſt it, do ſay againſt it; for as I end that 2. ſect of my 2. chap. where I prove the ſtars to be both ſigns and cauſes, I may here, you ſee, again triumphantly ſing, <hi>Et ſi Scriptura, &amp; ipſe Deus nobiſcum quis contra nos?</hi> If the Scripture and God himſelf be with us, who can be againſt us?</p>
                     <p>Wherefore you ſee now what great cauſe the Penner of that rabble had to ſay after theſe evaſions and juggles, <hi>Thus with a touch it appears that Mr.</hi> Rameſey <hi>is deceived in his concluſion to the ſaid proofs, that one of them were enough to convince any man the ſtars have influence; for, nor one, nor all, nor an hundred ſuch, are in any ſhew ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a prudent man of this,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Thus you ſee he denies the very teſtimonny of the word of God, nay although it were affirmed by an hundred places, and yet with all his wit he cannot refell the leaſt of theſe, ſave with his facing down with a bold forehead, which to the judicious will be but a laughing ſtock; for now it is moſt manifeſt, that whereas he ſaid, I was then in a dream, he is in ſuch a dream that he knoweth not where he is, nor how to beturn or betake himſelf for refuge, but by railing and ſpitting his venome Viper-like againſt me and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I have wounded him to the quick; for it is moſt apparent, that (although he ſaith <hi>thus with a touch, &amp;c.</hi>) he hath ſo ſlightly touched my Arguments that they yet ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken; and had he not ſaid <hi>thus with a touch,</hi> we had not known whether he had touched them or no.

                     <p>So alſo when I prove further, that Aſtrology is a lawful Art, being not prohibited by the Word of God, their Reply is, <hi>it is onely my paſſing my word for it;</hi> but I would fain ſee them paſs any ſound word or Argument againſt it, and not content themſelves with theſe ſilly and weak come-offs.</p>
                     <p>Again, in that 4. Sect. I come further to ſhew that, <q>We ſee by experience, that God doth (ſo far is he from diſallowing and prohibiting the practice of Aſtrology) abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely allow of both the Art and Artiſts, in his ſhewing of blazing-ſtars to them onely that ſtudy Aſtrology (not to the vulgar and proficient in other Arts) to forewarn his people of the danger and puniſhment to come; and if it were not ſo, he might as well ſhew ſignes of his future pleaſure to the Illiterate by common vulgar things, as in heaven, to the learned Aſtrologer who can onely judge of their effects.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now but warily obſerve their Reply, and thou wilt have fit matter of laughter; for in the 38 page, they ſay <hi>that my alleadging that God ſhews blazing-ſtars onely to Aſtrologers, is a grot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> untruth,</hi> Confeſſed by thouſands of the vulgar yet alive in England, <hi>who ſaw the blazing-ſtar many nights that appeared afore the Swediſh wars in</hi> Germany; <hi>for what hinders but ſhepherds, ſaylers, watch-men, and Illiterates ſhould perceive that which is obvious to the common eys of man-kind, and diſtinguiſh a Comet from a ſtar by his neerneſs, moti n, and his feather or long taile?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And truly herein they have told us a long tale to no purpoſe; for ſhould I deny that ſuch things can be diſcerned that are obvious to the common ſenſe of ſeeing, I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed render my ſelfe as ridiculous as they have in not apprehending my words, who deny not in the leaſt, but that they may plainly be ſeen of Sailers, Watchmen, Shepheards, illiterate Hay-makers, alſo dolts and Aſſes if they be not blind or aſleep, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to my Argument; for I was to let my Reader know that God more eſpecially (allowing of the ſtudy and contemplation of his heavenly creatures in his ſervants) ſheweth ſuch things as are <hi>Comets</hi> and <hi>Blazing-ſtars</hi> to Aſtrologers onely; I ſay becauſe they onely of all other men, are the ableſt to judge of their effects and portences, that the people might be forewarned of their miſery and the like; for otherwiſe he might ſhew his wonders in common vulgar things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Neither the Doctor nor Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus underſtand Engliſh or Senſe.</note>But if we obſerve, it is wonderful to ſee how learnedly theſe zealous blades by this their Reply prove that God (contrary to what I have alleadged) doth not in the leaſt allow of Aſtrology, or the Students thereof, by this his ſhewing of Comets or Blazing-ſtars; and that this my Argument conduced not to the validity of the Art or Artiſts, and not to come off ſo blewly to argue on what was never affirmed; but poor men they are to be excuſed come once to talk to them of Comets and Blazing-ſtars, and you put them quite out of their ſphear: therefore I ſhall onely propound this queſtion to them, and look for an Anſwer when they are able to underſtand Engliſh; they ſay I am ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully out in my Latin, becauſe I interpret not the words of the <hi>Bachharen</hi> Councell <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> but deliver the ſenſe of them. I thought I had writ to men, which would have been content with the ſenſe, and not to children that muſt have it word by word expounded; but however, this muſt needs be a Bull to affirm that therefore I was out in my Latin, but they cannot deny they are in this place out in their Engliſh, which is a far greater fault, and deſerves both the <hi>ferula</hi> and <hi>flagellum,</hi> and therefore I ſay I ſhall onely ask them this queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they underſtand neither Engliſh, ſenſe nor honeſty, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thereby they may come to underſtand what I ſaid; <hi>viz.</hi> whether it was the <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> I ſpake of, or the <hi>Shepheard, Sailer, Watchmen,</hi> and <hi>Illiterates</hi> they ſpeak of, that told them the Comet in 1618. <hi>foreſhewed the Swediſh wars in</hi> Germany, that they talk of?</p>

                     <p>EVen in that ſame 4. Sect. having thus (as you have heard) ſhewed the legality of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and validity of the ſtudy thereof, not being prohibited by God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I conclude then, that whatever Doctor <hi>Homes</hi> alledgeth was the Law of the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt it, was of no validity; ſince of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (if warranted by the Word of God) it muſt be allowed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, eſpecially the godlier ſort of Conncels, whoſe Acts and determinations will be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on piety and the Word of God; and if otherwiſe, I value not what their cenſure is; for they are but men and (guided by their own reaſons and opinions) fraile, ſubject to infirmities and errours; <hi>

                     <p>To which in their 39 pag. they Reply, <hi>that as I prove Aſtrology not to be condemned by the Word of God, juſt ſo (and no wiſelier) do I prove it not impugned by Councels, namely by bare facing it down with a bold forehead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I deſire no better proof that it is not condemned by Councels then this; for if their wiſdomes will admit this to be proved as wiſely, and juſt as I have the other, which all their wit you ſee, could not in the leaſt and weakeſt point ſilence, my Argument will be good and firm enough, and evident to the Reader, that they remain as yet by them unſhaken, and that they have no other refuge but <hi>barely to face it down with a bold</hi> and impudent <hi>forehead,</hi> eſpecially being in the former ſo ſhamefully bafled.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore now it reſteth I ſnew you the full power and ſubject of Aſtrology, and how far I maintain or allow of the Art, and here deſiſt, referring you for further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to that diſcourſe of mine, which is able to juſtifie theſe my words, ſince for all that the Replyers thereunto can ſay, the Art remains ſtill unſhaken, and it unanſwered; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had but ſmall reaſon to title that weak piece, <hi>Judicial Aſtrology Judicially condemned,</hi> when alas there is hardly a judicious ſentence to be found between the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end thereof, unleſs borrowed of ſome other Author, neither are they or it able to ſhew their faces before the judicious and impartial Judges of the matter, without ſuffering condign condemnation themſelves.</p>

                     <p>LEt us deſcend now unto the <hi>Sun.</hi> We are by Gods bleſſing come now to the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is ſucceſſively next to be treated on; he is under <hi>Mars,</hi> placed in the midſt of all the Planets, being the chief light and preſident of them all, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as a Judge or King amongſt his Nobles;<note place="margin">The order of the Planets.</note> for as <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above his ſphear, ſo are <hi>Venus, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> beneath him; wherefore ſome of the Antients have aſcribed to him chief rule, and made him, as it were, an Emperor amongſt the Stars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saturn</hi> is his Vice-roy, for that all Planets give unto him their light, or do homage and reverence unto him, by reaſon of his ſlowneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath aſſigned him chief rule and dominion in the Realm, for that he is of a temperate, ſober, good, honeſt and religious inclination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mars</hi> is his chief Captain, or General of all his Forces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venus</hi> is Receiver, or Maſter-Comptroller of his houſe, by reaſon ſhe is nearer <hi>Sol</hi> then any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercury</hi> hath aſſigned him chief Secretary of State, by reaſon when the King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any Progreſs or Journey, he goeth; and when the King ſtayeth, ſo doth alſo <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> for he is never far from his beck.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luna</hi> is his Standard-bearer, being furtheſt from him; ſhe is alſo, as I may ſay, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, Meſſenger, &amp;c. to do his buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>The fixed Stars of ſeveral magnitudes, are Officers and Commanders under theſe; I mean thoſe eſpecially of the firſt, ſecond and third magnitude; the other are only ſubjects, as it were, to the above-named, or equivalent to common people.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore then upon the meetings of theſe Superiors, are concluded the riſe, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, confirmation, alteration, proſperity, ſcarcity, plenty, poverty, beginning and ſubverſion of States, Kingdoms, Empires, Common-wealths, and what not? nay and the whole government of the Elements and this Elementary World, and all things and cauſes external and internal in them, as in a Councel or Senate, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>DIligently note this Chapter. The Reaſons why the ſigns are (as aboveſaid) in that manner attributed and aſſigned to the dominion of the Planets, I thought good here to relate, that the Students <hi>in this Noble Art</hi> may not want grounds and reaſons for their Rules; as alſo that they may be able to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the proudeſt Antagoniſt. We will then, according to our method begin with the Luminaries,<note place="margin">Of the Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries and their houſes.</note> viz. <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> who have <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> aſſigned them by reaſon of their heat, which is cauſed through their nearneſs to our <hi>Zenith</hi> or Cardinal point; the <hi>Sun</hi> hath allotted him <hi>Leo,</hi> for that it is moſt agreeable unto his nature: beſides, we ſee that the <hi>Sun</hi> being naturally hot and dry, doth ſhew its effects more forcibly in this ſign then in any other; for though <hi>Aries Sagittary</hi> be alſo fiery ſigns, yet is he not ſo hot, powerfull nor efficacious therein, as in <hi>Leo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> hath <hi>Cancer</hi> for the ſame reaſon allotted to her government, it being moſt agreeable to her temper: for <hi>Cancer</hi> is the firſt ſign of all the reſt that are move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and watry, and ſo more agreeable with her temper and quality then any of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Oh ♄ and his houſes.</note> 
                        <hi>Saturn</hi> becauſe he is naturally cold, and an enemy to heat, and the higheſt and moſt remote from the Luminaries of all the Planets, hath therefore aſſigned him <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> and <hi>Aquaries,</hi> which are the oppoſite ſigns to <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> wherefore they are cold and moyſt; and by reaſon of this their <hi>Oppoſition, Saturn</hi> is reputed hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the moſt obnoxious and malevolent of all the Planets, by reaſon he thus oppoſeth the Luminaries that are the Lamps of light, life and nutrition.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe <hi>Jupiter</hi> is placed under <hi>Saturn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of ♃.</note> he hath allotted him thoſe two ſigns that go before and after <hi>Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Aquaries,</hi> viz. <hi>Sagittary</hi> and <hi>Piſces,</hi> which are in a <hi>Trine</hi> to the houſes of the Luminaries; <hi>Piſces</hi> his night-houſe to <hi>Cancer</hi> the houſe of the Nocturnal Luminary; and <hi>Sagittary</hi> his day houſe to <hi>Leo</hi> the houſe of the Diurnal Luminary: wherefore they are temperate, and by reaſon of this their Amical Aſpect he is concluded aſſiſtant, temperate and good; fortunate and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent to mankinde, and the greateſt Fortune of all the Planets.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mars</hi> in order followeth <hi>Jupiter,</hi>

                     <p>And becauſe <hi>Mercury</hi> is carried below the reſt of the Stars,<note place="margin">Of ☿.</note> the two remaining ſigns are given him, viz. <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Virgo,</hi> preceding and following the houſes of the Luminaries; and becauſe he is on neither ſide, and never diſtant from the <hi>Sun</hi> above one ſign, he inclineth naturally neither to good nor bad, but is adjudged to be partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of the nature of the Planet to which he is joyned.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Aries</hi> then being the cauſe and original of all things;<note place="margin">Of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>

                     <p>But the reaſon why the Planets are after this manner divided into terms, is briefly this. The Sages and Philoſophers in former Ages followed this rule;<note place="margin">The reaſon why the terms are ſo attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi>
                        </note> firſt, to obſerve what Planet had moſt dignities in a ſign; whether by Exaltation and Houſe, Triplicity and Houſe; or Houſe, Exaltation or Triplicity only; and to that Planet that had two or more Dignities, they aſſigned the firſt term, whether he were a Fortune or Infortune; and if an Infortune have not two dignities in a ſign, they placed them laſt, and gave them the laſt term of the ſign, and the firſt term to the Lord of the Exaltation, to the Lord of the Triplicity, or the Lord of the Houſe; ever preferring him who hath two dignities, before thoſe or him that had but one, except only in <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Leo;</hi> for becauſe <hi>Cancer</hi> is the oppoſite ſign to the exaltation of <hi>Mars, viz. Capricorn;</hi> therefore is the firſt term of <hi>Cancer</hi> aſſigned to <hi>Mars;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Leo</hi> is the oppoſite ſign to the houſe and joy of <hi>Saturn,</hi> is the firſt term of <hi>Leo</hi> given
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61337:58"/>to him; to the Infortunes are given ſtill the laſt of all the ſigns, except of <hi>Leo;</hi> the laſt term is given to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the quantity of the terms are thus divided; when <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> have not two of the aforeſaid dignities in the ſame ſign, nor in the ſecond, third, nor fourth, they have ſeven degrees alotted them for their term: <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> becauſe they are infortunes (except in their own houſes) but five; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four, three, and two; <hi>Mercury,</hi> for that he is of a mixt nature, and naturally neither good nor bad, hath ſix degrees alotted him. In like manner, when a Planet hath the aforeſaid dignities, he hath aſſigned him one more, as <hi>Venus</hi> in the firſt term of <hi>Taurus</hi> hath aſſigned her eight degrees; and <hi>Saturn</hi> in the firſt term of <hi>Aquaries</hi> hath ſix degrees alotted him; and where <hi>Venus</hi> hath eight, you ſee <hi>Saturn</hi> hath but two in <hi>Taurus,</hi> being ſo much diminiſhed, he being very weak in <hi>Taurus:</hi> ſo alſo in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> you ſee <hi>Jupiter</hi> is increaſed one, being he is there ſtrong; and <hi>Mercury</hi> being weak, is diminiſhed one; <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath eight, <hi>Mercury</hi> but five; but why they are ſo divided throughout the ſigns, I finde no Author give ſufficient reaſons; I mean for this Table, according to <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> which, he ſaith, he found in an old rotten worm-eaten book, which was half conſumed with worms and age, in which, he ſaith, there was a long ſtory of the utility and reaſons of the terms: but by reaſon of the ſo much decay of the Book it could not be legible, ſo that he could not tranſcribe it; and ſo leaveth the Reader ſtill in doubt concerning this point, the clearing whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth much time and ſtudy, which ſhall not be wanting hereafter in me to beſtow (God granting me life and health) for the benefit both of the Art and Students therein. In the interim be content with what I have now delivered.</p>

                     <p>In like manner, if a Planet that is cold and dry, be in a term ſo likewiſe qualified, <hi>viz.</hi> cold and dry alſo, his cold and dryneſs is the more increaſed, and will work the more forcibly on the Inferiours he is ſignificator of: obſerve the ſame rule in all the reſt of the qualities and humors, ſtill remembring that a Planet is ſo much the more increaſed in ſtrength, by how much the more he is located in the places of his own temper and nature.</p>
                     <p>Moreover a Planet that is hot and dry, is leſſened of his vigour in a term that is cold and moyſt; ſo likewiſe is he augmented in heat if he be naturally cold and moyſt, and in a term that is hot and dry.</p>
                     <p>In like manner note, that if a fortunate Planet be in a fortunate term (I ſay note
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61337:58"/>in general) his goodneſs is the more increaſed and augmented, having more power and ſtrength to operate in any thing whatſoever he is ſignificator of; as if he have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of good, he is then ſo much the better; and on the contrary an evil or male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Planet in a malevolent ſign and term is the more miſchievous.</p>
                     <p>The Lord of a Termwhen he is in that Term, let it be what ſign it will, hath more power therein then the Lord of that ſign or the Planet that hath that ſign for his Exaltation, if he be Peregrine anywhere, which is as much to ſay, <hi>Poſſeſſion is eleven points of the Law,</hi> when there is but twelve. And if the Lord of any term be in his term, and the Lord of the ſign in another ſign in any Aſpect with him, the Lord of the term ſhall have more power in the ſign where he is, then the Lord of the ſign, and ſhall be principal ſignificator; and if the Lord of the term be in his own term and ſign, his ſtrength and power is ſo much the more increaſed.</p>
                     <p>What ever Planet be weak in a ſign, that Planets debility is leſſened, when or by his being in that part of the ſign he be where he hath any term; and if he be in term and ſign both of his own nature, he is very ſtrong and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as aforeſaid.</p>

                     <p>AGain, the Reaſons of the Vertues of each Planet through the 12. ſigns of the Zodiack in their proper Faces is very rare, and a great myſterie, which every capacity cannot reach unto; neither is it to be attained by any but who are great and profound ſearchers of the hidden myſteries of nature, and of great experience; for as water quencheth fire, and as fire dryeth up water; ſo one Planet over-ruleth another, and again is contradicted by the ſame; a term divides a face; a face divides a ſign; a ſign a triplicity; a triplicity the Zodiack, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>EVer remember, that the head and tail of the Dragon are not ſigns nor Planets, neither any Conſtellations; only <hi>Nodes</hi> and Places of the Ecliptick which the <hi>Moon</hi> cutteth, they have no Aſpect to any Planet; but they may be, and are aſpected by them; as touching their motion, it is according to the motion of the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their Nature is various according as they may be placed and aſpected; ſome of the Ancients have maintained that the head is good and fortunate; the tail bad and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate naturally, without any exception; others are of a contrary opinion, and ſay the Head is good when well placed and fortunately aſpected by the benevolents and fortunate Planets; but when afflicted and aſpected by the malevolents it is bad: Alſo that the Tail is good with the good Planets, <hi>viz.</hi> being joyned with them, or in aſpect therewith, and bad with the bad; and ſome again will have the Head when joyned with the Malevolents to be good, and with the Benevolents bad: alſo the Tayl when joyned, or in configuration with the Fortunes, they ſay is bad, and with the Infortunes good; for my part, I have ſtill (by that little obſervation I have made) found the <hi>Head</hi> to be good, and the <hi>Tail</hi> bad and unfortunate, as is the nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> naturally, but accidentally they may alſo ſometimes be both good and bad, I mean contrary to what they are generally reputed; thou mayſt follow which thou pleaſeſt; experience will be thy beſt rule when thou haſt done all; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let that together with reaſon be thy guide, till thou canſt inform thy ſelf in what is not fully comprehended by thee.</p>

This Equator divideth the whole ſphear into two parts, being placed directly betwixt the Poles of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Artick and Ant-artick, which is alſo divided by the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack into two equal parts; and thoſe points where the Zodiack cutteth the Equator are called Equinoctial points; and the points of the Zodiack which are the means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Equinoctials are called Tropicks or Solſteads, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtays or ſtations of the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Now as you have heard of the two principal Circles moveable, ſo it is requiſite alſo you hear ſomewhat of the two immoveable Circles, the Horizon and Meridian; we leave the <hi>Colures, Tropicks, Zones, Vertical, Parallel,</hi> and <hi>Polary Circles,</hi> &amp;c. to be taught by thoſe that have writ whole volumes thereof; for our intentions are but curſorily to ſpeak ſomewhat, that our ſcope may the better be underſtood; our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being to lay open that part of the Art which is not manifeſt in our tongue.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</note>The <hi>Horizon</hi> then is that Circle dividing the Hemiſphere of any place under it, from that which is above it, to which one of the Poles is always the Vertical point, and the other Pole the oppoſite; according therefore to the heighth of the point of each place, doth the Horizon of each place differ; for look how many places there are, ſo many Horizons are there; wherefore the Horizon of thoſe places which have the vertical or perpendicular point under the Equinoctial, is called the right Horizon; for that it paſſeth by the Poles of the World, and equally divideth the Equinoctial at right Angles; ſo likewiſe it is called a right ſphear; for that it ſeemeth to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed in reſpect of that Horizon, and the ſtars to make their motion directly by the univerſal motion of the ſphear.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Horizon</hi> of thoſe places whoſe Zenith is out of the Equinoctial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards either of the Poles, is called oblique; for that that Pole which the Vertical point is next to, is elevated above the ſaid Horizon, and the other is ſo much depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which therefore doth divide the Equinoctial at oblique angles, unequal one to another; for which cauſe alſo, the ſphear is ſaid to be oblique; being in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Horizon placed obliquely; and the ſtars turn obliquely in their univerſal motion. Wherefore it is clear, that all direct Horizons are of one diſpoſition; but among the oblique there are as many differences as are diſtances between the Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal point and the Equinoctial, or as the elevation of the Pole is divers above them.</p>

Know then, that every Meridian is a right Horizon to ſome places, and every right Horizon a Meridian.</p>

                     <p>LEarn now the uſe which is to be made of all this; if in any ſcheam or figure of Heaven you find a maſculine ſign aſcending, and the Lord of the aſcendant in a maſculine ſign, or beheld of a maſculine Planet in a maſculine ſign, then is the nature and actions of the thing in queſtion, or ſignified, maſculine; if in femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ſigns, the contrary, being more effeminate.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe if the Aſcendant, his Lord and the Planets beholding them be in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable ſigns, the thing denoted by the Aſcendant is fickle, unconſtant, and wavering in all particulars: if the aboveſaid teſtimonies be through fixed ſigns, the contrary; if in common ſigns, neither perfectly conſtant nor fickle, yet both, ſometimes the one way, and ſometimes the other.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, if the aforeſaid teſtimonies be in feral ſigns, the thing ſignified is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and temper of that beaſt repreſented by the ſign, as if <hi>Leo</hi> be the ſign aſcending, it is then bold, ſtrong, couragious, ſtately, hot and dry, &amp;c. If <hi>Taurus,</hi> it is ſolid, ſtaid and reſolved, yet of a ſlow muddy condition, cold and earthy.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe if in any figure of the Heavens the ſign aſcending be a fruitfull ſign, and the ſign of the fifth houſe a fruitfull ſign alſo, and the Lords of the aſcendant and fifth and the <hi>Moon</hi> be in fruitfull ſigns, it denotes fruitfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>So, if the ſign aſcending be a humane ſign, and the Lord of the Aſcendant and the <hi>Moon</hi> in humane ſigns, accordingly doth it ſignifie, as hereafter will more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſhown; ſo likewiſe of all the reſt, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>LEt us now deſcend to the ſeveral diviſions of the ſigns: it reſteth now you know why they are ſo called, and wherefore there are no more nor leſs then twelve, which according to <hi>Albumazer</hi> and <hi>Bonatus,</hi> is for theſe Reaſons: Firſt, as all things are made of the four Elements, which are ſubject to the ſigns, every ſign through the whole Circle of Heaven ruling one element or other: now there are four elements, every ſign-being over them; and they divided into three parts, as having relation to beginning, middle and end, as there is in all works, make juſt the number of 12. Beſides the number 12. is ſo compleat a number, as none is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with it; it having more particular diviſions then any other number, there being therein three fours, and four threes; two ſixes and ſix twoes: beſides they are ſo conſtituted from the diviſion of the Heaven (as you have heard already) divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to twelve parts, every part being a ſign; the firſt called <hi>Aries,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Taurus,</hi> the third <hi>Gemini,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The reaſon why <hi>Aries</hi> is called by that name.</note>The reaſon why they are called by theſe names, are briefly thus; the firſt ſign is called <hi>Aries</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>Ram,</hi>) becauſe when the <hi>Sun</hi> is therein, he approacheth to his higheſt point; heat thereby being increaſed, yet being mixed with the humidity of the preceding Winter, makes the temperature of the ayr hot and moyſt, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the complexion of the <hi>Ram:</hi> but there are ſome of the Ancients ſay that the ſtars in the ſigns being particularly obſerved, and as it were meaſured with a line the one from the other, they reſemble each the thing they are nominated.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſign is called <hi>Taurus</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>Bull</hi>) becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,<note place="margin">Why ♉.</note> the heat is more fixt and fortified, and the moiſture conſumed or expelled; the temperature of the ayr tending rather to dryneſs, which reſembleth the nature of a <hi>Bull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third ſign is named <hi>Gemini</hi> (ſignifying <hi>Twins</hi>) becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> therein cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a reduplication of heat; and all Creatures couple and ingender,<note place="margin">Why ♊.</note> every thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in its mate.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſign is called <hi>Cancer</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>Crab</hi>) becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,<note place="margin">Why ♋.</note> goeth, as it were, backward, (after the nature of the <hi>Crab</hi>) retiring towards the Equinoctial from whence he came, declining contrary to that of the <hi>Twins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth ſign is called <hi>Leo</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>Lion</hi>) becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> being therein,<note place="margin">Why ♌.</note> the heat is increaſed in great ſtrength and dryneſs, after the nature of the <hi>Lion,</hi> which is of a ſtrong, hot and dry nature.</p>
                     <p>The fifth ſign is called <hi>Virgo</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>maid</hi>) becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> therein hath his heat diminiſhed, and dryneſs ruleth, ſo that things ceaſe to increaſe,<note place="margin">Why ♍.</note> and the earth becometh barren; being of the nature of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> who is naturally tending to cold rather then heat, and is of her ſelf barren.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh ſign is called <hi>Libra</hi> (ſignifying <hi>Balance</hi>) for that the <hi>Sun</hi> being therein, both the length of the days and nights, as alſo the temper of the ayr,<note place="margin">Why ♎.</note> are in <hi>balance,</hi> as it were neither inclining one way nor other; the days and nights being of an equal length through the whole World; and the temperature of the ayr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the decayed heat of Summer, and the approaching cold of winter, is neither tending one way or other, but as it were in a balance.</p>
                     <p>The eighth is called <hi>Scorpio</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>Scorpion</hi>) becauſe when the <hi>Sun</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, cold and dryneſs is predominate, which are obnoxious to nature,<note place="margin">Why ♏.</note> and by reaſon
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61337:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>the natural temper of the ayr is hot and moyſt; the ayr is thereby corrupted, ſo that dangerous diſeaſes are ingendred thereby, as peſtilential Feavers, Plagues and the like.</p>
                     <p>The ninth ſign is called <hi>Sagittarius</hi> (ſignifying an <hi>Archer</hi> or one uſing to caſt darts) becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> being therein,<note place="margin">Why ♐.</note> the heat is overcome by cold, whereupon enſue Fogs and Froſts, and ſuch like, being (for the nature of the miſchief and hurt they do) as obnoxious, or equivalent to venemous Arrows or Darts.</p>
                     <p>The tenth ſign is named <hi>Capricornus</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>Goat</hi>) becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> being therein is fartheſt from the vertical point:<note place="margin">Why ♑.</note> ſo that by reaſon of the cold mixed with dryneſs, and the want of heat, which at that time is, the nature and diſpoſition of the ayr is melancholy, after the nature of the Goat.</p>
                     <p>The eleventh ſign is called <hi>Aquaries</hi> (ſignifying a <hi>Waterman,</hi>

I come therefore now, God enabling me, to ſhew you the Reaſons of the Ancients why the ſigns are ſtill reckoned from <hi>Aries,</hi> and ſo forward, ſince the Zodiack as well as the Heavens is round; and what is round hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and what hath no beginning muſt needs have no ending; and what wanteth beginning and ending, muſt needs have no middle: yet the twelve Coeleſtial ſigns are ſaid to begin at <hi>Aries,</hi> which is called the firſt, and ſo forward to <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is the ſecond, to <hi>Piſces</hi> which is the twelfth and laſt, for theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Why we reckon from ♈, and not from any other ſign.</note>Firſt, becauſe the Equator cutteth and divideth the Circle of the Zodiack in the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> and alſo the oppoſite ſign <hi>Libra;</hi> ſo that ſix ſigns are Northern,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61337:64"/>and ſix Southern; but the reaſon why the beginning is from <hi>Aries,</hi> and not from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi> is for that that part which is Northern is ſtronger and of more force, efficacy and power, and is more noble then that which is Southern; and <hi>Aries</hi> is the firſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſign, and ſo are all to the latter end of <hi>Virgo;</hi> the reſt are Southern, or decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Southward; wherefore ſince by all in general, the Northern ſigns are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtronger, and more noble then the Southern, did the Ancients appoint <hi>Aries</hi> the firſt of the ſigns, it being the firſt of them.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Why the ſigns are not placed according to the order of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>But let us proceed; the Ancients then (as aboveſaid) have placed firſt a fiery ſign, then an earthy ſign, after an aëry, and laſtly a watry ſign for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good Reaſons; firſt then, for that the four Elements receive an alteration and corruption one with the other by the inceſſant motion of the Coeleſtial ſigns, of which corruption and alteration there are generated four ſpecial qualities incident to elementary bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Generation, Conſervation, Corruption and Deſtruction. Now for that Generation is the chief and more noble quality, they began with that ſign which is the author of Generation; <hi>viz.</hi> a fiery; Next unto which quality is conſervation, fixation, durability or continuance, which is cauſed by thoſe ſigns by which nature is moved to conſtancy or duration, as corruptible things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive permanency and fixation, and they are earthy; After which is corruption the more inferiour quality; wherefore they placed in the third place that ſign which is author thereof (according to that of <hi>Ariſtotle, Aer vita eſt vivorum, deſtructio mortuorum:</hi> Ayr is the life of every living thing, but the death or corruption of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dead thing) <hi>viz.</hi> an Aëry ſign. Laſtly, the moſt ignoble and rejected is deſtruction, which is cauſed by the watry ſigns, wherefore they placed in the fourth place a watry ſign.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they have placed the ſigns in this manner, for that heat and cold are active: Drought and moiſture paſſive; and heat being ſtrong and more noble then cold, ſignifying or cauſing generation, as moſt deſerving, is placed firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a fiery ſign; ſo likewiſe for that dryneſs is the ſtronger of the Patients<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is put firſt of them, and next after heat, being an earthy ſign, cauſe of durability, and therefore placed next to generation; and becauſe corruption goeth before, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is an aëry ſign placed before the watry; and becauſe generation is the firſt beginning of any living thing, and therefore firſt placed, ſo is deſtruction being the laſt, placed laſt; continuation and corruption in the middle, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>They have alſo thus appointed the order of the ſigns, and placed a fiery ſign firſt, for that heat ruleth in fire, by which all things are quickned and vivifyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being the more noble quality (as aboveſaid) they place it firſt; and next unto it an earthy ſign, by reaſon of the nearneſs of its quality with heat, it being a dry ſubſtance: after it they place an aëry ſign, and preceding the watry, as participating with the humidity thereof; and laſtly, is the watry ſign placed laſt, as the fiery is firſt, being contrary thereunto in nature and quality; the paſſives being placed in the middle between the actives, which are placed in the extreams. There are ſeveral other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be produced for this order of the ſigns, but one or two may ſuffice to put to ſilence any caviller againſt this moſt noble Art: let us therefore now look into the natures and ſignifications of the ſigns.</p>

                     <p>MAny new Aſpects there are which we ſhall here omit, and here treat only of thoſe Aſpects of the Planets and ſigns which are moſt uſual and neceſſary. And they are thus called and charactered, <hi>Sextile</hi> ⚹, <hi>Quartile</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, <hi>Trine</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, and <hi>Oppoſition</hi> ☍: We omit here to ſpeak of <hi>Keplers</hi> new Aſpects, ſince theſe are the moſt neceſſary in the practiſe of this ſtudy. There is alſo a <hi>Conjunction</hi> thus Charactered ☌,<note place="margin">Of a ☌.</note> which is not properly termed an Aſpect, ſince a Planet is then ſaid to be in Conjunction with another when he is in the ſelf ſame degree and minute of one and the ſame ſign the other is in, and therefore cannot properly be ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or Aſpect him,<note place="margin">Its nature.</note> but is in ☌ with him: this ☌ is of nature neither good nor bad, but according to the ſignificators and their diſpoſitions and places is both, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good, and ſome times bad.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Sextile</hi> is ſo called,<note place="margin">Of a ⚹.</note> for that it is the ſixth part of the Zodiack, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charactered in this manner ⚹ with ſix ſtrokes; it conſiſteth of 60. deg. in length; as a Planet in the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> beholdeth another in the firſt degree of <hi>Gemini</hi> with a ⚹ Aſpect. Alſo if a Planet be in the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> he beholdeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fifth degree of <hi>Gemini,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Of a Platick aſpect.</note> with a ⚹; and this is called a <hi>Platick</hi> Aſpect, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the Orbs of the Planets in Aſpect; as <hi>Saturn</hi> in the 15. degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the 23: deg. of <hi>Gemini; Jupiter</hi> is in a ⚹ of <hi>Saturn</hi> by reaſon he is not fully elongated 9 deg. which the half orb of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> maketh, as <hi>Saturns</hi> half orb being 4. deg. and a half, and <hi>Iupiters</hi> 4. d. and a half, added together make juſt nine deg. and here you ſee them but 8. deg. ſeparated from a <hi>Partile</hi> aſpect,<note place="margin">Of a Partil aſpect.</note> which is when they are both in one and the ſame number of degrees and minutes as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. The uſe thereof is only thus; if in any ſcheme or judgement whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you finde the Significators in a <hi>Sextile Platick,</hi> you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident (if your light or Planet be applying) your buſineſs ſignified by thoſe Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators ſhall be accompliſhed when they come to the <hi>Partil</hi> aſpect, eſpecially if the more weighty Planet be retrograde or in reception by houſe or exaltation with the more light; if they are ſeparating and without reception, the contrary; for by how much they are ſeparated from the <hi>Partil</hi> aſpect, by ſo much the more unlikely is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſignified by the ſignificators ſo ſeparating to come to a concluſion; but look when they are fully ſeparated by the mediety of their Orbs, and about that time ſhall the buſineſs be fully broken of, except one of the Significators be juſt then Stationary, and then immediatly apply again, for then it hangeth in ſome ſuſpence, and after a while beginneth afreſh,<note place="margin">The reaſon why ⚹ and <g ref="char:trine">△</g> are good, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> and ☍ bad.</note> &amp;c. But you muſt note that application by ⚹ or <g ref="char:trine">△</g> is good, for they are Aſpects of love, amity and Friendſhip; yet the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> is more forcible and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for that a Planet in <g ref="char:trine">△</g> with another is out of houſes of the one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as fire with fire, earth with earth, water with water, and ayr with ayr. A ⚹ is by a fiery with an aëry, or earthy with watry, and therefore is not altogether ſo good as a <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, for that theſe agree not in every point; for fire is hot and dry, ayr hot and moiſt, agreeing partly, <hi>viz.</hi> in heat: ſo likewiſe earth and water; the earth is cold and dry, the water cold and moiſt, agreeing in coldneſs; for which reaſon a ⚹ is accounted indifferent good, and ſo likewiſe note that a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> and ☍ are naught, and of enmity and diſcord, quite contrary to the other, yet the ☍ is the worſe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Quartile</hi> is ſo called,<note place="margin">Of a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>.</note> for that it is the fourth part of the Zodiack, and is charactered four ſquare <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>; it conſiſteth of 90 deg. in length, and four times 90 deg. is 360. deg. you muſt know a <hi>Partil</hi> and <hi>Platick</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> by the ſame rule you know a ⚹,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61337:68"/>and ſo of all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, and ☍ But note that a buſineſs brought to paſs by the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> or ☍ of the ſignificators, cauſeth much diſcontent and ſadneſs, ſo that the buſineſs had better never been done, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Trine</hi> is the third part of the Zodiack;<note place="margin">Of a <g ref="char:trine">△</g>.</note> and is therefore charactered three ſquare and triangled <g ref="char:trine">△</g>; conſiſting of 120. deg. and three times 120. deg. maketh juſt 360. deg.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Oppoſition</hi> ☍, is that aſpect which divideth the Zodiack in two equal parts,<note place="margin">Of an ☍.</note> and is therefore charactered with a line between two round o's ☍ intimating the direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Orbs of two Planets; and it conſiſteth of 180. deg. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of Dexter and ſiniſter aſpects.</note> There is alſo an aſpect which the Ancients called Dexter and Siniſter; a Dexter aſpect is contrary to the ſucceſſion of the ſigns; a Siniſter is according to the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſigns; as a Planet in <hi>Aries</hi> beholding another in <hi>Leo,</hi> is a <g ref="char:trine">△</g> aſpect Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; a Planet in <hi>Aries</hi> beholding another in <hi>Sagittary</hi> is a 🜄 Dexter; the Dexter is not ſo good as the Siniſter. Here I may alſo give you ſome other reaſons why one aſpect is better then another (which I had almoſt forgot) which is in reſpect of the Luminaries; for as the <hi>Sun</hi> is <hi>Fons vitae,</hi> the fountain of life;<note place="margin">Other reaſons for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the aſpects.</note> ſo is the <hi>Moon</hi> of main power and efficacy by her forcible influence on inferiour bodies, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the light and influence of all the other Planets to us. I ſay in reſpect of them are the aſpects termed good or evil: for <hi>Saturns</hi> houſes behold the houſes of the Luminaries with an ☍, which is the worſt of Aſpects by reaſon he is the worſt of Planets: In like manner a <g ref="char:trine">△</g> aſpect is the moſt fortunate and beſt, for that the houſes of the beſt and moſt temperate Planet <hi>Jupiter,</hi> beholdeth the houſes of the Luminaries with a Trine aſpect, even as <hi>Capricorn</hi> is oppoſite to <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Aquaries</hi> to <hi>Leo;</hi> ſo is <hi>Piſces</hi> in <hi>Trine</hi> to <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Sagittary</hi> to <hi>Leo:</hi> and ſo is a <hi>Quartile</hi> the leſſer malevolent aſpect, for that the houſes of the leſſer fortune, <hi>viz.

Aries</hi> is in <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> to <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Scorpio</hi> to <hi>Leo;</hi> neither is this aſpect ſo bad as is an <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> for that <hi>Scorpio</hi> one of his houſes is in <hi>Trine</hi> to <hi>Cancer</hi> the houſe of <hi>Luna:</hi> Likewiſe a <hi>Sextile</hi> being from the houſes of the leſſer Fortune <hi>Venus,</hi> is of leſs force then a <hi>Trine,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo much for the aſpects of the Planets and Signs.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> Of the fixed Stars in the Zodiack; wherefore they are called fixed, their number, particular names, natures, magnitudes, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes and longitudes; and first of thoſe in <hi>Aries,</hi> as they are delivered by the moſt learned in this Art.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come here to ſay ſomewhat of the fixed ſtars, ſince without the true knowledge thereof our works will be imperfect, I mean our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as alſo theſe our labours without them would be but lame and imperfect. I ſhall but ſpeak of ſome of the ſtars chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt notable, and thoſe of the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth magnitude, except here and there of ſome more obſcure. I ſhall refer my Reader, if he be curious herein, to the peruſal of <hi>Copernicus, Tycho, Lucas Gauricus, Stadius</hi> and <hi>Sconerus,</hi> and what others treat of in this Nature; yet what I here ſet down may ſuffice for any judgement whatſoever in the Art of <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> of what part thereof ſoever it be. The method I follow, is briefly firſt to <hi>declare</hi> unto you the <hi>number, names, nature, magnitude, latitude and longitude of the moſt notable fixed ſtars in the Zodiack, of the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth magnitude: as alſo thoſe (of the ſame magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) both on the North and South part, and theſe will ſerve for ever, and in all Regions
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61337:69"/>and places through the whole Globe of the Earth, except their longitudes, which will vary ſomewhat in reſpect of the Equinoctial;</hi> wherefore I ſhall only give you the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their longitudes.</p>
                     <p>We will begin with <hi>Aries</hi> being the firſt ſign (as you have already heard) and ſo forward; but before we begin, I think meet firſt to let you know, wherefore theſe ſtars are called fixed ſtars, that there may be nothing in the Art which the Student (if occaſion ſerve) may not give a reaſon for; for it is my deſire to have knowledge increaſe, and ignorance and envy perpetually put to ſilence: The reaſon then why they are called <hi>fixed ſtars,</hi> is, for that they are indeed fixed and immovable, never ſtirring, but they are violently carried about with the Heavens by the firſt mover (as aboveſaid) not having any peculiar motion of their own as the Planets have, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But let us now come to the fixed ſtars, their number, natures, names, magnitudes and latitudes; and firſt of <hi>Aries:</hi> in <hi>Aries</hi> there are <hi>twenty five</hi> notable fixed ſtars.</p>

                     <p>In the ſecond column you have their ſeveral names, ſignified by this inſcription on the head thereof, <hi>The names of the fixed ſtars in</hi> Piſces.</p>
                     <p>Upon the head of the third column you have <hi>their Natures,</hi> intimating that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, and over againſt every ſtar is ſet the Character of the Planet of whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it participates; as for example, over againſt <hi>the right ſhoulder of Pegaſus,</hi> we finde ♂, ♃, v. ☿, intimating that the ſtar on the right ſhoulder of <hi>Pegaſus</hi> is of the nature of ♂, ♃, or ☿, v. ſignifying <hi>vel,</hi> in Engliſh <hi>or:</hi> again we ſee over againſt the two ſubſequent ſtars ♃ P ♀, ſignifying they are of the nature of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and partly of <hi>Venus</hi> P. ſtanding for partly, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>On the head of the fourth column you finde <hi>magnitude,</hi> intimating that by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures underneath, and over againſt each ſtar is ſhewn the magnitude of each ſtar; as over againſt <hi>the right ſhoulder of</hi> Pegaſus, you finde 2 l. intimating it to be of the ſecond magnitude ſignified by 2. and ſomewhat leſs, ſignified by l. and note that in the ſame column where you finde g. it ſignifieth <hi>greater</hi> in any of the Tables.</p>

                     <p>You are ſufficiently inſtructed by other Authors of the Nature and ſignification of the houſes; their ſeveral diviſions you heard already in the 25. chapter of this ſecond Book; it reſteth therefore we now proceed to ſhew the reaſons why the houſes are ſo ordained, as the angle of the Eaſt to be the firſt houſe, and ſuccedent to it the ſecond, &amp;c. and ſo of the reſt; as alſo why the Ancients aſſigned them thoſe ſeveral ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which we commonly attribute unto them; for ſuch hath been their curioſity therein, that there is no one thing appertaining to the life of man or affairs or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents therein, which hath not ſignification from one houſe or other, &amp;c.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Of the firſt houſe, why it is ſo, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſuch and ſuch ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>The firſt houſe then is that houſe which is the Eaſt Angle or corner of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, or the Aſcendent; It is called an Angle for that it repreſents one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal points, as the ſeventh may the other: and the tenth and fourth the Tropicks, &amp;c. It is called the Aſcendent becauſe the Sun doth there aſcend in our Horizon; Alſo in what ever Climate it be that houſe where the Sun aſcendeth or riſeth is the Aſcendent of that place; and it is called the firſt houſe for that it is the firſt that doth repreſent itſelf unto us upon the birth of any Infant, Revolution, or any work; ſo that what Sign at that time is aſcending or on the point or cuſp of this houſe, is Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator (together with the Planet that is Lord thereof, the Planet locally therein preſent, or in aſpect thereof,<note place="margin">And ſo of any thing or Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, &amp;c.</note> or the Lord thereof) of the Native (as ſay the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients) For the Sign ſhall ſhew the complexion, form and ſhape of the body of the Native having relation to the Planets in aſpect therewith or neer in preſence; And the Lord thereof ſhall declare his diſpoſition, quality and inclination, having alſo reſpect to thoſe Planets in conjunction or configuration with him, &amp;c. It hath ſignification of the life of the Native, for that it is the firſt houſe, as life is the firſt and chief beginning of any one, and firſt eſteemed or preferred before any other enjoyment under the Sun; for what pleaſure can there be in any thing when in the enjoying thereof the life is taken away? Certainly, though it be never ſo much to be deſired upon this conſideration, it will be altogether left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant hath ſignification of the Life and diſpoſition of the Native, or any thing or work began.</note>It hath ſignification of the life of the Native alſo, and the beginning of any work, for that the Infant is unrevealed or known till it is borne: ſo is this firſt houſe or Aſcendent unſeen, and is in obſcurity (as unto us) till it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in our Horizon, &amp;c. In Revolutions, Eclipſes, and great Conjunctions and the like it hath ſignification of the common People of any place where theſe happen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the ſecond houſe.</note> The Second houſe which is the ſuccedent to the Aſcendent, is ſo called for that it ſucceedeth the Aſcendent, and aſcends after it, and is therefore alſo called the ſecond houſe; it hath ſignification of the Riches and Subſtance of the Native or Querent, as alſo their aſſiſtance; for that next unto a mans life, is his wealth or livelihood to be regarded, and as wealth is an aſſiſtance and aid in all matters or buſineſſes of or in the affairs ordinary of mans life, hath it alſo ſignification of aſſiſtance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Third houſe is ſo called for that it in order followeth the ſuccedent of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent; it hath ſignification of Brethren, Kindred, Neighbors and Alliance, for that it is in * of the Aſcendent, ſubterranean: it hath alſo ſignification of ſhort jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,<note place="margin">Of the third houſe.</note> being the houſe oppoſite to the Ninth, ſignifying long journeys, the reaſon of which you ſhall have hereafter in its place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the fourth houſe.</note>The Fourth houſe or Angle of the Earth, or Northern, is ſo called for that it in order followeth the third; it hath ſignification of immoveable goods for that it is an Angle, and that of the Earth which is fixed; alſo heritages, lands and houſes, for that it is a terranean and earthy Angle; alſo it hath ſignification of hidden treaſures and the like, for that it is ſubterranean and not viſible in our Horizon; it ſignifieth alſo the father of the Native or Querent, for that he is the firſt cauſe of generation, as the earthy Chaos was the firſt original of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the fifth houſe.</note>The Fifth houſe is the ſuccedent of the Angle of the Earth, and therefore is ſo called. It hath ſignification of mirth and jollity, it being in <g ref="char:trine">△</g> to the Aſcendent; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo private pleaſure and delight, it being ſubterranean and in <g ref="char:trine">△</g> with the Aſcendent, and for the ſame reaſon hath ſignification of all manner of paſtime and recreation, as drinking, revelling, ſporting, gaming and all kind of recreation pleaſing the fancies and tempers of men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the ninth houſe.</note>The Sixth houſe is the Cadent from the North Angle, and is in order the ſixth houſe from the Aſcendent: it beholdeth not the Aſcendent; it hath therefore ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſickneſſes, of what kind ſoever it be; it hath alſo ſignification of Servants, Bond-men and women and Slaves; and of Cattle of the ſmaller ſort for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as having no loving familiarity or correſpondency with the Aſcendent in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Of the ſeventh houſe.</note>The ſeventh houſe is the angle of the Weſt, and by reaſon it in order followeth the ſixth, is the ſeventh from the Aſcendent; it hath ſignification of open enemies, for that it is the oppoſite houſe to the Aſcendent; and for the ſame reaſon hath ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of theft, or the thing loſt; adverſaries in Law-ſuits, and the like; it hath in like manner ſignification of women in general, of marriages. I could never finde the reaſon why the ancients have ordained the ſeventh or oppoſite houſe to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, to ſignifie the wife of the Native, and women in general, except for that they are ſo contrary to the diſpoſition of men, the one being for the moſt part ſolid and reſolved, the other ſickle and unſtable as their mother the <hi>Moon;</hi> as alſo that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prove the deſtruction of men rather then aſſiſtants and comforters, (for which they are made) as <hi>Eve</hi> was the deſtruction of <hi>Adam, Dalilah</hi> of <hi>Samſon;</hi> and many the like examples I could here relate both out of the Holy Writ, and other writings; but ſince the ſubject is ſo vile and mean it is not worthy the pains, wherefore that very example of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wiſeſt of Mortals, may ſuffice, who notwithſtanding he had ſo large a portion of the ſpirit of God, was by this Sex, drawn to Idolatry and many other ſins againſt the living God; inſomuch that it hath ſtaggered the learnedſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Divinity, and put them to a <hi>non plus</hi> to imagine (by any concluſion) whether he was ſaved or no: but lets return to our buſineſs, ſince I may thus conclude of them that they prove either the greateſt comforts or the worſt of afflictions to men.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XLII.</hi> Of the diviſion of the Houſes into twelve equal parts.</head>
                     <p>NOw then you are firſt to know that the <hi>Horizon</hi> cutteth or divideth the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens into two Hemiſpheres, the upper and the lower, parting ſix of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into one Hemiſphere, and ſix into the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the upper hath 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7th. houſes, the lower the 6, 4, 5, 3. the 2d. and firſt houſe.</p>
                     <p>And as the Heavens are divided into two Hemiſpheres by the <hi>Horizon,</hi> ſo are they alſo cut by the <hi>Meridian</hi> into two equal parts, ſo that by theſe two Circles the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are divided into four equal parts, and every of the parts by ſections and points of other Circles are divided into three parts, ſo that the whole Heavens are cut into 12. equal parts; which the moſt learned in this Art have called Manſions or houſes.</p>
                     <p>The diviſion which the <hi>Meridian</hi> makes, is to divide the Heavens into the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Occidental parts, ſix houſes being Oriental, ſix Occidental, or ſo inclining: Oriental are the third, ſecond, firſt, twelfth, eleventh and tenth; Occidental ninth, eighth, ſeventh, ſixth, fifth and fourth.</p>
                     <p>Now you muſt know that the four equal parts aboveſaid are called (by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Science) quadrants, becauſe each part is the quarter or fourth part of the Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Quadrant is that part of the Heaven which lieth between the middle of the Heaven and the Aſcendent or Horoſcope; and this is the Oriental, Aſcending, Infant, Maſculine, Sanguine and vernal Quarter, and it hath the twelfth, eleventh, and tenth houſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Quadrant is thoſe three houſes, or that part lying between the points of the tenth and ſeventh, and this is the Youthfull, Feminine, Meridional, Cholerick, Summer Quarter, containing the ninth, eighth and ſeventh houſes.</p>
                     <p>The third Quadrant is from the point of the ſeventh houſe to the <hi>Imum Coeli</hi> or point of the fourth, and is called the Occidental, Manly, Maſculine, Melancholy and Autumnal Quarter, including the ſixth, fifth and fourth houſes.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Quadrant is from the <hi>Imum Coeli</hi> to the point of the Horoſcope or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, and is the Septentrional, Feminine, Phlegmatick, old Age, and Winter Quarter.</p>
                     <p>The Angles are the moſt powerfull houſes; for a Planet therein hath more power and efficacy then another (in any other houſe) that is but equally dignified: but know that the houſes are in ſtrength as followeth, yet <hi>Ptolomie</hi> preferreth the mid-heaven, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>1, 10, 7, 4, 11, 9, 5, 2, 3, 8, 6, 12.</p>
                     <p>So that the meaning thereof is no more but thus; A Planet in the 1. and another in the 10. equally dignified, that hath more power which is in the Aſcendent; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that in the 10. precedeth that in the 7. and ſo know of the reſt. And ſo much of the diviſions of the twelve houſes.</p>

                     <p>AMongſt the Planets here are ſeveral things to be known of all that ſtudy this Science, and they are in number which are moſt material 23. therefore I would have thee diligently obſerve this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Direction, Retrogradation, Stationary, Application, Separation, Prohibition, Refrena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tranſlation, Reception, Fruſtration, Peregrination, Combuſtion, Cazimi, under the Sun beams, void of Courſe, beſieging, Oriental, Occidental, Superior, Inferior, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazer, Almuten</hi> and <hi>Haiz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Direction.</note> A Planet is ſaid to be direct when he moveth in his Natural motion, directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as <hi>Saturn</hi> in the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> goeth into the 2, 3, and ſo forward; this is direction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Retrogradation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Retrogradation.</note> or a Planet is ſaid to be Retrograde when he goeth backward or contrary to the ſucceſſion of the ſigns, as <hi>Saturn</hi> in the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> going into the 30, 29, and 28 degrees of <hi>Piſces,</hi> &amp;c. is Retrograde, or goeth backward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stationary</hi> is,<note place="margin">Stationary</note> when a Planet ſtands ſtill, or moveth neither backward nor forward, as the Superiors do ſometimes four days together, &amp;c. as you have heard before, and this happeneth both before direction and retrogradation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Application</hi> is,<note place="margin">Application.</note> when two Planets (it mattereth not which) draw neer the rays or bodies of each other by <hi>Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect; and this may be done three ways; yet you are to know that a more weighty Planet, or that which is ſuperiour cannot apply unto the lighter or inferiour, except when he is retrograde.</p>
                     <p>The firſt manner of Application is when two Planets are direct, the weightier in more degrees, and the lighter in fewer; as if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in five degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in three, here <hi>Jupiter</hi> applies unto <hi>Saturn</hi> by <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and this is a direct Application.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond when both are Retrograde, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> in three degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and ♄ in the firſt, here <hi>Jupiter</hi> applies unto the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> by a Retrograde motion.</p>
                     <p>The third is when the one is Retrograde and in more degrees of a ſign, and the other direct and in leſs, as if <hi>Jupiter</hi> were in four degrees of <hi>Aries</hi> direct, and <hi>Saturn</hi> in ſeven Retrograde, here <hi>Saturn</hi> applyeth to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> to him, and this is a mutual Conjunction; underſtand the ſame when they apply by Aſpect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Separation</hi> is,<note place="margin">Separation.</note> where two Planets have been either in <hi>Partile Conjunction</hi> or aſpect, and are going from it; as if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in 8. degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in 9. here <hi>Jupiter</hi> is ſeparated one degree from the <hi>Partile Conjunction,</hi> yet he ſhall not be ſaid to be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſeparated till he be the full half orb of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and his own half orb diſtant from him; for every Planet both in <hi>Conjunction</hi> and Aſpect is admitted his half orb and the half orb of the other Planet joyned unto him; as the half orb of <hi>Saturn</hi> you have heard is 4. degrees 30. minutes, and ſo likewiſe <hi>Jupiters,</hi> the which being added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make 9. whole degrees; and therefore till <hi>Jupiter</hi> be thus many degrees elon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated or ſeparated from <hi>Saturn,</hi> he ſhall not be ſaid to be fully ſeparated, neither ſhall their ſignification be inffectual for that time; underſtand the ſame of an aſpect ſtill admitting or allowing the half orbs of both Planets, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prohibition</hi> is,<note place="margin">Prohibition.</note> when two Planets are applying to <hi>Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect, and before they come to joyn themſelves another comes to <hi>Conjunction</hi> or aſpect of the Planet applyed to; as if <hi>Saturn</hi> were in 10. degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in five applying to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in four degrees of <hi>Aries;</hi> here <hi>Mars</hi> being
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61337:77"/>ſwifter then <hi>Jupiter,</hi> comes firſt to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and prohibites <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp;c. the ſame obſerve in an Aſpect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Refrenation</hi> is, when a Planet is applying to another,<note place="margin">Refrenation.</note> either by <hi>Conjunction</hi> or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and before he cometh to be joyned he becomes Retrograde: as if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in ſeven degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in three, here <hi>Iupiter</hi> applies (they being both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect) to a <hi>Partile Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn;</hi> but before he can attain thereunto <hi>Iupiter</hi> becometh Retrograde, and ſo refrains by going backwards to come to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who goeth direct forward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of light and nature is,<note place="margin">Tranſlation.</note> when a light Planet ſeparateth from a more weighty one and preſently applyeth to another more heavy; as <hi>Saturn</hi> in 16 degrees of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in 9. and <hi>Mars</hi> in 10. here <hi>Mars</hi> ſeparateth from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and tranſlateth the light and nature of <hi>Iupiter</hi> to <hi>Saturn,</hi> to whom he next applies; and this is in the like manner done by Aſpect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reception</hi> is, when two Planets are in each others dignities; for then they are ſaid to receive one the other;<note place="margin">Reception.</note> and this may be accompliſhed as many ways as there are dignities of a Planet; as <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Capricorn;</hi> here is reception be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Saturn</hi> &amp; <hi>Mars</hi> by houſe, <hi>Aries</hi> being the houſe of <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp; <hi>Capricorn</hi> the houſe of <hi>Saturn;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Cancer</hi> is reception by exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Capricorn</hi> being the exaltation of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Cancer</hi> of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> In like manner <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Sol</hi> in <hi>Gemini,</hi> is reception by triplicitie; the fiery triplicity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Suns</hi> by day, and the aëry <hi>Saturns,</hi> &amp;c. in like manner of term and face.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fruſtration</hi> is,<note place="margin">Fruſtration.</note> when a lighter Planet would come to <hi>Conjunction</hi> with another more heavy, and before it doth accompliſh it, the more weighty Planet is joyned unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as <hi>Saturn</hi> in 20 degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in 19, and <hi>Mars</hi> in 15, here <hi>Mars</hi> applies to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> but before he can attain thereunto, he is fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſappointed by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who comes firſt to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peregrination</hi> is, when a Planet is in a ſign wherein he is a ſtranger, as it were,<note place="margin">Peregrination.</note> by being neither in his own houſe, exaltation, triplicity, term or face, and therefore then he is very weak, as <hi>Saturn</hi> in the firſt 26 degrees of <hi>Aries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Combuſtion</hi> is,<note place="margin">Conbuſtion.</note> when any Planet is not diſtant from the <hi>Sun</hi> eight degrees and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty minutes either before or after his body; as <hi>Saturn</hi> in the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> in 8. and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in 16. here both <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> are combuſt of the <hi>Sun;</hi> but you ſhall ſay <hi>Iupiter</hi> is moſt afflicted; for that Planet to whom the <hi>Sun</hi> approaches is more daminified then that from which he ſeparateth;<note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Sun beams.</note> and you muſt know that a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ſtill remains under the <hi>Sun</hi> beams till he is fully elongated 17 degrees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cazimi</hi> or a Planet in the heart of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cazimi.</note> is when he is not diſtant from the <hi>Sun</hi> 17. minutes; as if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in 3. degrees 15. minutes of <hi>Aries,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> in three degrees and 30. minutes of <hi>Aries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Void of Courſe</hi> is, when a Planet is ſeparated from another,<note place="margin">Void of courſe.</note> and doth not during the time of its continuance in that ſign, apply again to any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beſieging</hi> is,<note place="margin">Beſieging.</note> when any Planet is placed between the bodies of the two Malevolents <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> as if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in 5. degrees of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in 15. and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in 10. here <hi>Iupiter</hi> is beſieged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oriental</hi> is, when a Planet riſeth before the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Oriental.</note>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Occidental</hi> is nothing elſe but when a Planet ſetteth after the <hi>Sun,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Occidental.</note> and is ſeen above the Horizon after him.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Planets that are placed above the Globe of the <hi>Sun,</hi> are called Superiour,<note place="margin">Superiour.</note> and they are <hi>Saturn, Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi>

                     <p>

                        <p>But although this be the Judgement of the Antients who ſay, Look to the aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the Nativity or Queſtion and make your Election accordingly:<label type="milestone">

                           </label> Yet I ſay (as moſt agreeable to truth and reaſon) Let the Figure of the Revolution of the years of the world for that year be regarded, and therefore or according thereunto Elect your buſines, as being the True Radix, root or ground thereof. But Note that if the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and its Lord be unfortunate in your radix, or the Revolution of the world, there is no Election can be made any wiſe to advantage the body or the party for whom you would elect an advantagious time; and ſo conſider and underſtand of any Election whatſoever, <hi>viz.</hi> If the chief ſignificator of any buſineſſe be unfortunate in the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, ther can be no time Elected to prevent the miſchief threatned; for whom the Lord hath ordained to deſtruction or puniſhment, he cauſeth one thing or other to be incident unto that party ſo ordained to puniſhment, either by inclination or caſualty (according to his Divine wil and preordination and the harmonious concordancy of Aſtrology with Divinity &amp;c.) that it might come to paſs; (and ſo on the contrary for a mans happineſs, but this comes to paſs through repentance) for I have ever found men in this condition either to go on ſtill in their ways without reproof, or being reproved, will take ſo ſmall notice thereof, as that they will hardly believe it, or have an inclination to ſtudy amendment or prevention of the evil; wherefore theſe particular things in Elections ought to have their dependency on the generall fates.</p>
                        <p>But as I have but now ſaid, the figure of the Revolution of the world for that year ought to be regarded and concluded the radix or ground-work of all your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections; for according to the nature of the ſignificator therein muſt your Election be framed,<note place="margin">Divers events happen to men on the election of one and the ſame hour and minute.</note> or your ſhall never be perfect in this Art. Hence it is that often we ſhall finde ſome kind of men and occupations thrive and proſper ſome years more then in others; and again on the contrary, do all what they can, their buſineſs ſtill and endeavours go backward; The reaſon is, their ſignificator is more fortified or debilitated in the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61337:85"/>and we ſee that ſuch ſhall in an Election by <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> have a good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous day,<note place="margin">The reaſon thereof.</note> and upon the ſquare or oppoſition of the <hi>Moon</hi> to <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though on a miſchievous day; becauſe theſe malevolents were chiefe rulers or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators of the buſineſs in hand, things or perſons, &amp;c. in the Radix. Conſider alſo the places of any Eclipſe or Great conjunction in every year. So that when your true ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator is known, and his eſſential and accidental fortitudes and debilities, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, the following Rules being diligently and warily obſerved, there being an harmony and ſuch a concordancy betwixt the Coeleſtial Creatures, and our Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affairs, according to that excellent ſaying of <hi>Hermes, there is nothing here beneath that is not governed and ruled by what is above.</hi>

                           <hi>Bonatus, Haly,</hi> and others have been ſo curious in their Elections of all works, that they have given directions for weaning of children, which though of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, I thought fit notwithſtanding to deliver here their opinions; wherefore then in weaning of children, let the <hi>Moon</hi> be remote from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and in none of the houſes of <hi>Venus,</hi> thus <hi>Bonatus:</hi> and others ſay, if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in her 12th. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or in <hi>Libra,</hi> when you wean the childe, it will never more care for the breſt: Again, ſome of the Antients hold, that if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in any of the earthy ſigns, as are <hi>Taurus, Virgo</hi> and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the childe will affect the eating of herbs or roots; if in <hi>Leo,</hi> to eat fleſh; if in <hi>Cancer, Scorpio</hi> or <hi>Piſces,</hi> fiſh; and if in any of the other ſigns, it will eat whatever you give it. Theſe are the opinions of ſome learned; but there is no doubt if the childe be ſeparated from the breſt of the Nurſe when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in <hi>Scorpio</hi> or <hi>Aries,</hi> remote from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> it will do the feat; a little experience and tryal of theſe Rules will put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of doubt; theſe are not things of much value or regard; but ſince it hath been the curioſity of the Ancients to write thereof, I have mentioned them (as I have ſaid) wherefore if thy curioſity be deſirous to make tryal of theſe Rules, thou mayſt follow which thou thinkeſt moſt agreeable to reaſon and truth, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>A Man ſhall, if he have regard to the writings of the Antients, find, that there hath ever been in former Ages ſome, and indeed moſt of the more learned ſort of men, who have applied their ſtudy to this heavenly myſterie: and truly it cannot be by me believed, that ever there was an Age ſince the World had its firſt original that was ſo ſtupid and void of underſtanding, as not to have ſome ſons of the Hermetick Art produced therein; and as by the more learned and refined ſpirits of all Ages it hath been ever in great eſteem and practiſe; ſo is it ſtill in this we live, and by very many both ſtudied and cheriſhed, it being notwithſtanding by the muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms and ſottiſh Aſinego's of the World ſlighted and contemned, and no more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued then a Diamond is with Hogs, both ſlighting that unſpeakable and never to be enough valued and eſteemed knowledge, and the Students or Searchers thereof, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they account nothing more ridiculous, then that which they vulgarly call THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE, thus giving way to folly to condemn and not eſteem that great bleſsing they are in no wiſe thought worthy of; nay not ſo much as worthy the honour to be accounted in the number of thoſe that believe there is ſuch a thing in Nature: but it mattereth not what ſuch ſtupid Dolts conceive out of their ſhallow and conceited brains, that can admit of nothing but ignorance; wherefore let it be ſtill unto them a STONE and rock of offence; both it, and all thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſouls, the Lovers thereof, ſhall by me be ever in great eſteem, and be more dear unto me then any worldly felicity: but I fear I tranſgreſs, let us therefore to our matter in hand.</p>

                        <p>It advantageth greatly alſo, if the Aſcendent and the <hi>Moon</hi> be in earthy ſigns, and chiefly <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Virgo;</hi> alſo in <hi>Capricorn</hi> when ſhe is placed with <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, and the light of the time in the mid-heaven; for this ſignifies the City ſhall continue a long time, and the Inhabitants thereof ſhall profit therein and have a good end; alſo if the Aſcendent be a common ſign, it ſignifieth there ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inhabitants and multiplicity of ſtrangers and ſeveral ſorts of people, eſpecially if many Planets behold the Aſcendent and the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Know alſo that in building or laying the foundation of Cities, if <hi>Saturn</hi> be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Dragons tail,</hi> there ſhall be much miſchief and trouble to old men and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in that City. If <hi>Iupiter</hi> be joyned with <hi>Dragons tail,</hi> much miſchief will be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Nobles of the City or the Aldermen, &amp;c. If <hi>Mars,</hi> there will be evil by fire, diſcord and debate, and perhaps the Magazine will be blown up often, or be in danger thereof, or the <hi>Militia</hi> will be damnified. If the <hi>Sun,</hi> evil is threatned to the chief Ruler of the City or Mayor. If <hi>Venus,</hi> it will fall on the Women of the City. If <hi>Mercury</hi> be joyned with <hi>Dragons tail,</hi> there ſhall be much deceit and many lyes, and cozening deceitfull tricks uſed. If the <hi>Moon,</hi> the common ſort of people ſhall be afflicted. So on the contrary judge the good ſucceſs, of thoſe ſignified by thoſe Planets free from impediment, and in a fortified condition, at the time you laid the firſt ſtone of your foundation; if the Planets are all ſtrong, judge fortune and good ſucceſs in general, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">To know the ſignification of any thing or caſualty, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to, or in any City and how to judge thereof.</note>Moreover know, that the Aſcendent of a City hath ſignification of the life of the Inhabitants: the ſecond houſe of its riches, ſtrength and power: the third, of the Laws thereof; the fourth, of the end of the Inhabitants cauſes, as alſo the end of the City, and the ſecret places therein, as hidden treaſures and the like; the fifth, of the children of the Inhabitants: the ſixth, of the ſervants and infirmities and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies incident to the inhabitants; the ſeventh, of the Marriages of the Citizens; the eighth, of their great houſes; the ninth, of their manners, cuſtoms and Voyages: the tenth, their habitations, Maſterie and occupations, alſo their honour, power and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the eleventh, their friends and aſſiſtants; the twelfth, their great Cattel, Plots, and ſecret Enemies, alſo impriſonments and poverty.</p>
                        <p>So that from hence you may judge methodically, and particularly of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular quality of any City; for in what houſes you finde the Malevolents, and ſuch houſes as you ſee are afflicted and impedited, you may judge the ill ſucceſs and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune (according to the ſtrength of your afflicting Planets) to thoſe things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the houſe afflicted and impedited, &amp;c. So likewiſe of the good ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe things ſignified by thoſe houſes you finde aſſiſted by the Benevolents and well fortified.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Saturn</hi> is in any of the angels alone, and not aſſiſted by the Fortunes, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies delays and ſlowneſs in thoſe things ſignified by the angle he is in, and in the actions and undertakings of the Citizens in general; if <hi>Mars</hi> be there he denotes many miſchiefs, dammages, robberies, and corrupt or over hot ayr.</p>
                        <p>But if at the beginning of the building, or laying of a Cities foundation, ♄ and ♃ behold each other with a good aſpect, and be in angles and other good places of Heaven, ſtrong and well dignified, it denoteth the City ſhall be of long continuance, and increaſe in glory and plenty a long time.</p>

                        <p>In this manner of exerciſe you muſt chiefly have reſpect to the place and motion of the <hi>Moon;</hi> for if ſhe be in <hi>Taurus</hi> applying to <hi>Venus</hi> eſpecially by a good Aſpect, you may ſafely eat Beef, either boyled, roaſted, ſtewed, or any otherwiſe dreſſed.</p>

                        <p>It is generally taken for granted (amongſt the unskilful) that the ſeventh and fourteenth days are Critical, and that theſe are the firſt and ſecond <hi>Criſis;</hi> but tis no wiſe true as to build on, but the true <hi>Criſis</hi> is thus known.</p>

                        </p>

                        <p>Secondly, As touching the Age, Phyſick by a prudent and wiſe Phyſician ought not to be adminiſtred to Infants nor decrepid old age, nor much to youth; for to the Child it is needleſs ſince it cannot duly work its effect, where there is neither ſtrength nor matter to work on; and in age it worketh in a manner the ſame; but without doubt it muſt needs debilitate Nature in both; in youth a little at the Spring and Fall may be advantageous; but to take it often, it hindreth the natural heat and concoction, and ſo conſequently the radical heat and moyſture being hereby abated, the days of the party muſt needs be ſhortned.</p>

                        <p>Fortifie then the aſcendent, its Lord, the <hi>Moon,</hi> its Diſpoſitor, the <hi>Part of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> and its Diſpoſitor, alſo the ſign and Lord of the ſixth, and its Diſpoſitor, and let the Fortunes be above the earth; make alſo the Lord of the ſixth apply to the Lord of the Aſcendent, or make the Lord of the Aſcendent diſpoſe of the Lord of the ſixth; this makes thy ſervant diligent and reſpectfull to thee, and loving: But if there be an Infortune in the fourth, or ſixth, the ſervant will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, a fugitive, and no wiſe conſtant.</p>
                        <p>If thou canſt not obſerve all this, place the Lord of the ſixth in the Aſcendent, or tenth, or in <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> therewith; and if thou wouldeſt have him advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to thee in thy eſtate; place the Lord of the ſixth in the ſecond, but let him not be eſſentially dignified yet free from impediment or affliction of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volents; or if thou canſt not place him therein, let him be in <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or in reception of the Lord of the ſecond, or diſpoſed of by him, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Elections under the ſignification of the ſeventh houſe, are ſuch as appertain to Marriage, Wars, Duels, to the making of Inſtruments for War, Partnerſhip, or ſuch things as are done between two, to ſeek Fugitives, to make Thieves, confeſs the truth, to hunt, fiſh or fowl, to buy Arms, to ſtorm Caſtles and make Batteries, and to play at any Game, and the like; thus much then of the Elections in general; let us now deſcend to particulars, and firſt (as hath been ſaid) of Marriages.</p>
                        <p>Know that in this manner of Judgment, it is moſt requiſite to know exactly your ſignificators; otherways it is impoſsible ever to frame any ſure or ſolid judgement.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore then obſerve, that the Aſcendent, its Lord, the <hi>Sun</hi> and the Planet from whom the <hi>Moon</hi> laſt ſeparated, are ſignificators of the Man; the ſeventh houſe, its Lord, <hi>Venus</hi> and the Planet to whom the <hi>Moon</hi> next applies, of the woman.</p>
                        <p>The tenth houſe, the Lord thereof, and the Planet or Planets therein or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration therewith, or with the Lord thereof, hath ſignification of thoſe things that ſhall happen between them, <hi>viz.</hi> whether good or ill.</p>
                        <p>The fourth houſe, its Lord, and the Planet or Planets therein, or in configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, or with its Lord, hath ſignification of the event and end of the Marriage.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore in this matter when you make any Election, have ſpecial regard to the <hi>Moon;</hi> for according to her fortitude or debility, thou mayeſt judge the good or bad event of any of theſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mercury</hi> is not to be rejected, for he hath ſignification of the children which they are to have, ſo that if at the time of Marriage or contract, he be well digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and in <hi>Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect with the Fortunes, thou mayſt aſſuredly ſay the married couple ſhall ſoon have a child. The Antients have ſaid the ſame, he being but in configuration with the Fortunes; but I hold it moſt true if he be in his own digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61337:112"/>alſo at that time, and beholding them out of the fifth houſe, and the more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red will this be, if they be in prolifical Signs.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Signs of ſtrife and diſcord between them.</note>Let the <hi>Moon</hi> be increaſing in light and motion, at the time of the Marriage, and ſee that ſhe be not joyned to any Infortune in the Aſcendent; for that ſignifieth that the parties then Married ſhall be continually in ſtrife and contention, brawling and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; ſo likewiſe if in either of their Nativities this poſition be found, then that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that hath this in the Radix ſhall have moſt power and bear greateſt<note n="*" place="margin"> This is to be underſtood of ſuch as live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not of grace. <hi>Venus</hi> a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Planet to be fortified.</note> way; yet note if the <hi>Moon</hi> upon ſuch a conſtellation in any ones Nativity be above the earth, that party that hath her ſo poſited ſhall be inclined (notwithſtanding the ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention the party is naturally prone to) to make peace again, and compoſe all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                        <p>But what ever you do, be ſure you fortifie <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſee that ſhe be not Cadent, Retrograde, Combuſt, nor in her Fall or Detriment, nor in any malevolent configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the Infortunes; for it is impoſſible the Marriage ſhould be good where <hi>Venus</hi> is impotent or afflicted; neither can it be very bad if ſhe be ſtrong and well aſpected of the Fortunes; for in Marriages ſhe is the chief ſignificatrix; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if poſsible, make <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be in <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> with <hi>Venus,</hi> or ſhe in reception with him, and the <hi>Moon</hi> in the houſe of either <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> or in one of their terms; and, if poſſible, alſo in good aſpect with them, or place the Lord of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth in <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> or Lord of the Aſcendent; but make the Lord of the ſeventh apply or elſe be diſpoſed of by them either by houſe, exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, triplicity, term, or face; but by houſe or exaltation is beſt, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>The Sages have taught that in this manner of Judgement you have ſpecial regard to the place of the Lord of the Aſcendent; for if he be in the Eaſt-part of Heaven, place the <hi>Moon</hi> in the Weſt; and if he be in the Southern part, place her in the Northern; and ſo on the contrary if he be in the Weſt, or North part.</p>

                        <p>In ſetting out againſt, or invading of an Enemy, it is not ſafe whilſt the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is ſtrong, for the Aſcendent and the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> are ſignificators of the Rebels: Neither is it ſafe for thoſe Rebels to ſtirr when ſhe is weak. Underſtand the ſame of the Lord of the Aſcendent.</p>
                        <p>But it is very neceſſary to begin againſt Rebels or an Enemy, when <hi>Mars</hi> is in the Eaſt part of Heaven, and between the tenth degree of <hi>Taurus</hi> and the tenth of <hi>Leo,</hi> and from the tenth degree of <hi>Scorpio</hi> to the tenth of <hi>Aquaries:</hi> This thou muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve if the Enemy or Rebels are Eaſtward.</p>
                        <p>But if they are Weſtward, begin to invade them when <hi>Mars</hi> is in the Weſt part of Heaven, from the tenth degree of <hi>Leo</hi> to the tenth degree of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and from the tenth degree of <hi>Aquaries</hi> to the tenth degree of <hi>Taurus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And truly it will be advantageous for both parties; if they are careful of not begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their buſineſs in evil hours, <hi>viz.</hi> when the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> is combuſt, or joyned to the <hi>Sun</hi> in one degree and minute, and for the ſpace of twelye hours after, <hi>viz.</hi> Combuſt hours, for theſe times are to be ſhunned in the beginning of any good work, and ſo likewiſe at the time of any <hi>Athazer:</hi> You have heard what <hi>Athazer</hi> is, in the ſecond Book, and laſt Chapter.</p>

                        <p>If any war or quarrel be begun in theſe Combuſt hours, the beginner ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or there ſhall much evil and damage befall his perſon and his ſouldiers and aſſiſtants, <hi>viz.</hi> if it be begun in the firſt four hours of any of the twelve Combuſt hours, the beginner ſhall be deſtroyed; in the ſecond four hours he ſhall be wounded or damnified in his body or own perſon; And if it be begun in the four laſt hours, his ſouldiers and aſſiſtants ſhall chiefly ſuffer.</p>

                        <p>MAny times it ſo happeneth that a man may have occaſion of ſuſpition of ſome that he ſees ſecretly laying their heads together or whiſpering; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſatisfie thy ſelf of what they Treat, have regard unto the firſt and ſeventh houſes and their Lords; for the Aſcendent, its Lord and the Planet from whom the <hi>Moon</hi> laſt ſeparated, are ſignificators of him that began the Diſcourſe, and that ſet his face towards the South; and the ſeventh, its Lord and the Planet to whom the <hi>Moon</hi> next applies, ſhall ſignifie the other or him that hath his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North or Eaſt; the thing on which they diſcourſe ſhall be ſignified by the tenth houſe and its Lord; the fourth houſe, its Lord and the Diſpoſitor of the <hi>Moon,</hi> ſhall ſhew the end of their Diſcourſe or Reſult, but you muſt know the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ruling the ſign wherein the <hi>Moon</hi> is, ſhall have more power then the Lord of the fourth.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore if you finde that the Lord of the tenth apply, or is rather inclining to the Aſcendent, or be in reception with its Lord, ſay that the party ſignified by the Aſcendent ſhall obtain or prevail with the other in what they diſcourſe; but if you finde the Lord of the tenth, and ſeventh in the like manner, then judge the contrary.</p>
                        <p>See alſo if the Lord of the Aſcendent be a fortunate and good Planet, or evil and unfortunate; for if it be either <hi>Jupiter, Venus,</hi> or the <hi>Sun,</hi> and they free from the Malevolent aſpects of the Infortunes, ſay the party ſignified by the Aſcendent ſhall ſpeak truth and be honeſt in his dealings and words; but if he be <hi>Saturn, Mars,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> he ſhall diſſemble, lye and deal treacherouſly; in like manner judge of the party ſignified by the ſeventh, according to his ſignificator &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Look to what Planet or part of Heaven the ſignificator of lies and treacheries caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> and aſpect, and ſay to ſuch men or things ſignified by the Planet beheld or the place of Heaven, he intends miſchief; In like manner, judge he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends good if his ſignificator be fortunate, eſpecially to thoſe men and things ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Planet and place of Heaven beheld, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>So likewiſe if you finde the Lord of the tenth fortunate, you may judge they treat of honeſt, good and lawfull things; but if he be unfortunate, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and baſe buſineſſes; Examine the nature of the ſign, and the Planet that is Lord thereof, and you ſhall ſoon be acquainted with the nature and quality thereof.</p>
                        <p>And if the Lord of the fourth, or the Planet ſignifying the accompliſhment or end of the buſineſs be malevolent and unfortunate, the buſineſs in agitation ſhall end with miſchief, treachery and deceit; but if he be a fortune and well dignified, judge the contrary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Of Gaming.</note>And now as touching gaming, you are to underſtand that the Aſcendent and its Lord are ſignificators of the party that challengeth or beginneth firſt; the ſeventh houſe and its Lord, of the other: Fortifie therefore the Aſcendent and its Lord (if that ſide thou favoureſt) and debilitate the ſeventh and his Lord; for then ſhall the party ſignified by the Aſcendent win; and if thou placeſt the Lord of the eighth in the ſecond, or applying thereunto or to its Lord, or the Lord of the Aſcendent, it will be the better; and if thou canſt not place him thus, put him in the Aſcendent, but let him be in reception with the Lord of the ſecond or firſt; but let him not receive the Lord of the ſecond, eſpecially when they are in play.</p>
                        <p>Let alſo the <hi>Moon,</hi> when they begin, ſeparate from a Fortune and apply unto another, and let it be above the Earth; place alſo the face or breſt of him you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſhall win againſt the <hi>Moon,</hi> and let her be fortunate and ſtrong, leaſt ſhe prove more advantagious to the other.</p>
                        <p>He that challengeth or deſireth another to play, if thou wouldeſt have him win, place his face oppoſite to the <hi>Moon,</hi> and let her be in the Eaſt part of Heaven; but if thou wouldeſt have the challenged to be gainer, place the <hi>Moon</hi> in the Weſt part of the Heavens, and let him ſit in the Eaſt part of the room with his face againſt her.</p>
                        <p>If the Aſcendent be a movable ſign, and the Lord thereof in a movable ſign, as alſo the <hi>Moon</hi> when the Game is begun, they will not continue long in play; if it be fixed, and the Lord thereof and the <hi>Moon</hi> in fixed ſigns, judge the contrary; if common, indifferent, and as ſoon as they have left off, others will begin.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Moon</hi> apply unto a Fortune, he that begins ſhall win, but if to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, he ſhall loſe; if the <hi>Moon</hi> apply to a Fortune, and then immediatly after to an Infortune, he ſhall win at firſt, and loſe at laſt: But if ſhe apply to an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and then immediatly after to a Fortune, he ſhall loſe at firſt and win at laſt; In like manner if ſhe apply unto a malevolent, the challenger or he that beginneth ſhall loſe; and ſo in the ſame manner judge of the other.</p>
                        <p>In playing at Cheſs let the <hi>Moon</hi> apply to <hi>Mercury,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Mars,</hi> for that in this Game there is variety of Play; and if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in reception alſo with them both, it will be the better; and if the ſign be common, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Gameſters will advantage themſelves much.</p>
                        <p>Moreover in playing at Tables, let the <hi>Moon</hi> apply to <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> and if a Fortune be in the Aſcendent, the beginner ſhall win, eſpecially if an Infortune be in the ſeventh; in like manner judge on the other ſide if the Fortune be in the ſeventh, and the Malevolent in the Aſcendent; alſo if the Lord of the Aſcendent be in the Mid-heaven, the beginner ſhall win; and if the Lord of the Aſcendent, and the Lord of the ſeventh be in <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> they ſhall fall out in their play.</p>
                        <p>When the Lord of the Aſcendent is Retrograde, it ſignifieth the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall cozen; but if both the Lord of the Aſcendent and Lord of the ſeventh be equally well dignified, in the tenth there ſhall not be much winning on either ſide; alſo when <hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> are in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they ſhall have many words and wrangle in their Play, and if <hi>Mars</hi> be in the Aſcendent, they ſhall tell many lyes, eſpecially the beginner.</p>
                        <p>But if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in the Aſcendent, there ſhall be no winning on either ſide, but after a tedious diſpute they ſhall leave off and draw ſtakes; and if <hi>Jupiter</hi> be in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61337:117"/>Aſcendent, they ſhall part in choler; and if <hi>Venus</hi> be therein they ſhall break off merrily; and if the <hi>Moon</hi> be there, he that ought to have it go on his ſide ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly win; you have heard before of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Note, that when the ſign aſcending is a common ſign at the beginning of any two playing, it ſignifies that as ſoon as they have left off, others ſhall begin; and thus much for this; remember what hath been ſaid, and you are well enough; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo let the <hi>Moon</hi> when you go out of your houſe intending to play be in your face, and the Lord of the Aſcendent applying to the Fortunes, and in the mid-heaven or in the eleventh houſe, and how ever, let him be above the earth, free from combuſtion, and the affliction of the Malevolents.</p>

                        <p>And as I diſſent from the Ancients in placing this Election, ſo do I alſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from them in the matter thereof; yet if thou wilt follow them thou mayeſt, pleaſe but thy ſelf and I am content.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Of returning from any jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note>Fortifie therefore in this manner of judgement the ninth houſe at the time of your ſetting forth, the Lord thereof and the <hi>Moon,</hi> as alſo the ninth and its Lord, and the place of the <hi>Moon</hi> in the Revolution of the year of the World or Quarter (if it be a year wherein ſuch are admitted) and if poſſible, let <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> or both be in the ninth, or applying thereunto, or to the Lord thereof, or the <hi>Moon</hi> in both
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61337:119"/>theſe Schemes, and let theſe places however you do, be free from the malevolent configurations of the Infortunes, and ſee that there be no Infortune in the ſecond houſe in a return, nor in the eighth when thou ſetteſt firſt out; for the ſecond is then in lieu of the eighth, being the eighth from the ſeventh which hath ever ſignification of the place intended or travelled to; and therefore it ſeemeth requiſite unto me, that you alſo fortifie the ſeventh houſe at the time of the firſt journey, as alſo its Lord, and the place of the <hi>Moon</hi> at that time. But thou wilt the better underſtand how to make an Election for returning, by knowing how to ſet out at firſt.</p>
                        <p>

                              </gap>urneys or Voyages.</note>Wherefore you muſt know the Aſcendent is the ſignificator of the City, Town or place from whence any one Travels; the ſeventh of the place intended or journeyed to; the tenth houſe, hath ſignification of the ways or paſſages in the journey, and the fourth of the ways or paſſages in the return.</p>
                        <p>Look then how theſe places are affected, and accordingly judge; for if they are aſſiſted by the preſence or aſpects of the Fortunes, good is promiſed; if by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolents, evil, according to the Nature of the thing ſignified by the houſe afflicted or aſſiſted; as if the ſeventh be fortunated, you may judge ſucceſs and happineſs to the Traveller in the Country or place to which he goes; if the tenth, he ſhall have good ſucceſs in his journey, ſhall be ſafe and merry and in good health; if the fourth, judge the ſame at his return, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In beginning of any Journey, let the <hi>Moon</hi> be increaſing in light and motion, free from impediment and affliction of the Infortunes; for an Infortune afflicting the <hi>Moon</hi> doth more hurt then when it afflicteth the Aſcendent; and let her not be in the ſecond, eighth, fourth ſixth, nor twelfth, but in the fifth, and if poſsible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held of the Fortunes; however it cauſeth good ſucceſs, and gain in the journey, health of body, and that he ſhall quickly return to his own content; and let <hi>Mercury</hi> be free from combuſtion and the malevolent aſpects of the Infortunes, as alſo the Lord of the Aſcendent, and let him be placed in a good place of Heaven; place alſo a Fortune in the Aſcendent or ſome Angle, for ſuch an Election denotes ſafety, agility, joy and gladneſs in the journey; and let not the <hi>Moon</hi> be in the Aſcendent neither going nor returning, for it ſignifies ſickneſs, and much grief in the journey.</p>
                        <p>But if thou canſt not obſerve all this, let the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> apply unto the Aſcendent, as alſo the Lord of the Aſcendent, and let them be free from the malevolent aſpects of the Infortunes; alſo proſperity and good followeth if the <hi>Moon</hi> be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> or be beheld of them by a <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But you muſt know there can no Election be framed without reſpect to the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the World, and the true ſignificator of every man therein, according to his quality; the which when thou haſt found, fortifie it and its Lord, the <hi>Moon</hi> and the ſign, and Lord of the Aſcendent at the ſetting out, and the ſign ſignifying the thing or buſineſs occaſioning the journey, and the Lord thereof, and have a ſpecial care, the Aſcendent be not Cadent; and if the journey be to the King, let the tenth in the Revolution of the year of the World be the ſign of the Aſcendent in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth; and if it be to obtain a reward at his hands, let the eleventh in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution be your Aſcendent, and ſo of the reſt, according to the ſignification of the thing deſired.</p>
                        <p>It is good alſo to place the <hi>Moon</hi> at the beginning of any journey in the tenth or fifth beholding her diſpoſitor, free from impediment and the afflictions of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in good aſpect of the Benevolents, and they alſo eſſentially dignified, and the <hi>Moon</hi> increaſing in light, and <hi>Mercury</hi> free from combuſtion, and free from impediment; and let not the <hi>Moon</hi> be in the ſixth, nor twelfth, for that ſignifieth impediment and delay in the journey.</p>
                        <p>But if ſhe be increaſing in light and motion, it will be ſoon accompliſhed, and that with ſafety and quiet; but if the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, or <hi>Saturn,</hi> or both be in the Aſcendent or ſeventh, or <hi>Saturn</hi> in the Aſcendent, and the <hi>Moon</hi> in the ſeventh, there ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the journey or place to which the Traveller tendeth, many grievous infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, loſſes, quarrels or ſlaughter unto him.</p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61337:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <p>If ſhe be in the 10th. or 11th, it is good; but if ſhe be in the third, fifth, or ninth, it will not be ſo well, in the ſeventh or fourth, worſe; but ſhe denotes miſchief moſt in the Aſcendent, ſecond, ſixth, eighth or twelfth.</p>
                        <p>And ſome of the Ancients have ſaid, that if any ſet forth in the day time <hi>Aries</hi> aſcending, they ſhall meet with Thieves; yet if they ſet upon the Thieves they ſhall overcome them; alſo if at ſuch a time any go againſt a Caſtle or ſtrong hold, they ſhall take it; and if the Aſcendent be <hi>Taurus</hi> when the Traveller ſetteth out, he ſhall gain and profit by Cattel, as Cows, Oxen and Bulls and ſuch like; if it be <hi>Gemini</hi> that doth then aſcend, he ſhall profit by arms or expert ſervants.</p>
                        <p>Alſo if it be <hi>Cancer,</hi> he ſhall be ſafe in health or fortunate in all things he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes; if <hi>Leo,</hi> he ſhall overcome, and win, and there ſhall evil happen to others for him; if <hi>Virgo,</hi> he ſhall be merry, and profit by ſervants.</p>
                        <p>Again, if it be <hi>Libra,</hi> he ſhall have a mean both of good and evil; in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> he ſhall toyl and labour, but ſhall not obtain his deſire, and there ſhall happen much ſadneſs unto him, but afterwards he ſhall gain a little; If <hi>Sagittary,</hi> he ſhall obtain his deſire, and ſhall profit by horſes and arms, and ſhall act ſomething, for which he ſhall receive a great reward.</p>
                        <p>Moreover if it be <hi>Capricorn,</hi> he ſhall be tyred, and the journey ſhall be tedious, and his deſires ſhall not be obtained; if it be <hi>Aquaries,</hi> his hopes ſhall be fruſtrate, and his enemies ſhall deceive him; but if it be <hi>Piſces,</hi> he ſhall advantage himſelf by precious ſtones, ſhall obtain his deſire and ſhall have his health.</p>
                        <p>Note that ſome of the Ancients have taken that punctum of time wherein the Traveller ſteps out of his houſe onward of his journey, and the degree aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then to be his ſignificator, and that degree which aſcendeth when he is juſt out of ſight of his houſe to be the ſignificator, together with its Lord, of the journey.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Ancients have in this place given us Inſtructions, if any journey be to Kings, Great men, Generals of Armies, Judges, Lawyers, Women, Learned men, Poets, and ſuch like, of what kinde ſoever they be, by making the <hi>Moon</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the ſignificator of the quality of the perſon a man intends to go to, and by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſignificator in a good place of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Aſcendent, tenth, or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, or in the houſe whereby he is ſignified, but by no means in the ſeventh nor fifth, for that ſignifies labour and trouble; as alſo if he be in the fourth or Occidental; but ſince I have already given you the exact ſignifications of the <hi>Moon</hi> to the other ſix Planets in a Table in the third Chapter of the firſt Section of this ſame third Book, as alſo hinted at the ſame in the ſixth Section and tenth Chapter, I ſhall not in this place make any repetition, but proceed.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Of making quick returns.</note>If thou wouldeſt ſoon return from thy journey, place <hi>Jupiter</hi> in a <hi>Quartile</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in his <hi>Sextile</hi> betwixt both the Fortunes, ſeparating from one, and applying to the other; or place the <hi>Moon</hi> in the room of the <hi>Sun</hi> increaſing in light and motion.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Of walking.</note>And as touching walking abroad, ſome of the Ancients have been large; but I ſhall omit their Rules as ſuperfluous in ſuch a matter which depends on the Will of Man; only I ſhall add thus much, that if the <hi>Moon</hi> be increaſing in light and motion, and free from impedition, applying to a Fortune, it will be the better,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61337:120"/>and the walk will ſeem more pleaſant and delectable then tireſome; for commonly when ſhe is weak, and in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> the time ſeems tedious, and the walker will be very ſad and penſive; and perhaps be ſubject to fals and other caſualties, when ſhe is ſo aſpected of <hi>Mars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And take this for an approved rule, that if the walker go to viſit any one, or to look for any thing, if the Lord of the ſeventh Houſe at the time of his ſetting out be in the Aſcendent, and the <hi>Moon</hi> in aſpect of any Retrograde-Planet with reception at the ſame time, he ſhall meet the party or thing he ſeeks or intends to viſit.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Of entring into any place.</note>Now as touching any Travellers entring into any Place, Town or City, you are to fortifie the ſign of the ſecond Houſe, and the Lord thereof, and place him in a good houſe above the earth, and the <hi>Moon</hi> in the third or fifth, or elſe in the eleventh, applying to a Planet receiving her, whether it be a fortune or no; and let your ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator never be under the earth, unleſs your buſineſs ſo require, or is to be kept ſecret.</p>
                        <p>Be ſure the <hi>Moon</hi> be not in the fourth, eighth, ſixth or twelfth, but place her in the ſecond, if poſſible, ſtrong and free from impediment, and applying to the Lord of the ſecond, or in reception of him.</p>
                        <p>And if he that entreth into any place would fain ſtay long there, let the <hi>Moon</hi> and the Lord of the ſecond be placed in angles;<note place="margin">To ſtay therein.</note> and it will not be amiſs in this buſineſs if he place the <hi>Moon</hi> in reception with <hi>Saturn</hi> by a good aſpect, and let the ſign of the Aſcendent and its Lord at the firſt entrance be fixed.</p>
                        <p>But if he would ſoon return from thence, let him place the <hi>Moon</hi> in the third, in a moveable ſign received;<note place="margin">To return quickly.</note> as alſo let the ſign of the Aſcendent at the firſt entrance be moveable, and the Lord thereof alſo in a moveable ſign, and place the Lord of the ſecond in the Aſcendent, and the Lord of the Aſcendent in the ſecond.</p>

                        <p>THE firſt thing we are to provide for any voyage at Sea is a Bark, Gallie, Ship or ſuch like Veſſel; wherefore it ſeemeth requiſite unto me I here ſhew a fit time for making of ſuch Commodities, and then we ſhall come to the time of Voyaging. Some of the Ancients have placed this Election in the fourth Houſe; but becauſe Voyages are under the ſignification of the ninth Houſe, and they cannot be accompliſhed without Ships, I thought it more convenient to place it in this Houſe.</p>
                        <p>In the compoſition or building of Ships there are three ſorts conſiderable; the firſt are ſuch as ſerve for War, the ſecond for Traffique or Merchandiſe, the third we term Gallies and ordinary Veſſels.</p>

                        <p>Wherefore if there be any Infortune in the Aſcendent at the time of deliverance, it denotes inſlavery and impriſonment again; place therefore a fortune in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and let the Lord thereof be well dignified and free from the Malevolent Aſpects of the Infortunes, and if poſſible let him be in <hi>Conjunction</hi> or loving Aſpect of the Lord of the Tenth, and received by him as alſo the Lord of the Twelfth, and if you can let the Lord of the Tenth be in the Twelfth, or applying thereunto, or to its Lord, and let him be alſo received of the Lord of the Tenth.</p>
                        <p>Make alſo the <hi>Moon</hi> increaſing in Light and Motion, and joined to Fortunes, and let the Fortune to which ſhe is joined either by Body or Aſpect be Oriental, and ſwift of motion alſo; but let not the <hi>Moon</hi> be in the Twelfth, nor beholding a Planet ſlow in motion; Neither let the Lord of the Twelfth be ſlow nor joined to any Planet but ſuch as are ſwift and well dignified; fortifie alſo the Tenth Houſe and its Lord, and let him not be impedited by any means; for then it ſignifieth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity in the party that is to free the other out of Priſon, fewds or ſlavery; wherefore it is requiſite alſo you dignifie the <hi>Sun</hi> who is the general Significator of power and authority, &amp;c.</p>

Chapter of our Second Book <hi>Of the Judgement of the Stars</hi>) that the <hi>Sun</hi> was in this very ſign, and in this very <hi>punctum</hi> at the firſt Creation, and therefore (I ſay) it is all the reaſon in the World his return thereunto every year ought to be the chiefeſt ground on which Aſtrologers are to build their judgements, touching the Natural events of all ſublunaries; eſpecially ſince he is (as you have been ſhewn in the firſt Book) <hi>Fons Vitae</hi> the Fountain of life, and <hi>Anima mundi</hi> the ſoul of the World, by which all things, as well Vegetatives as Senſitives have their ſubſiſtence and vivifying nouriſhment.</p>
                        <p>Beſides we ſee that when the <hi>Sun</hi> enters this Equinoctial all things increſe and flouriſh, the Trees and Earth grow green and bloſſom, and alſo fructifie by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees afterwards, which may alſo prove unto us the manifeſt certainty of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61337:131"/>that opinion, or rather affirmation of the Antients that the <hi>Sun</hi> was in this firſt ſign at the Creation of them; and truly, if we will be regulated by reaſon, it will be ſufficiently proved by the very Word of <hi>God,</hi> which although not expreſly <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> teſtifying ſo much unto us in plain words, yet will the Text delivered in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi> verſe 11. be ſufficient together with the ſequel, verſe 12. ſhewing the effect, be enough in all reaſon to evince the Carpers at both this <hi>Art</hi> and Artiſts tenets, which for the moſt part are guided by paſſion, errour and tradition in all their diſcourſes they publiſh againſt them.</p>

                           <note place="margin">See more of this in the firſt Book.</note>So likewiſe on the contrary, we ſee when he enters <hi>Libra</hi> which is the ſign oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to <hi>Aries</hi> and the other Equinoctial, all things decay and diminiſh in their vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative vigour; the earth becomes as it were barren, the leaves fall from the Trees, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>LOok that you can readily and exactly diſtinguiſh of your true ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators, as which Houſe and Planet denotes the King, which the People, which their Aſſiſtants, and which their Enemies, &amp;c. and from whence you are to inquire of the fertility and ſterility of the Earth, Wars or Peace, or any other Accident; otherwayes you ſhall never be able to come to any perfection in this moſt Divine Science.</p>
                        <p>Ever be ſure you weigh well the Fortitudes and Debilities of your Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificators, as how they are eſſentially and accidentally dignified (which you are ſufficiently taught in the eight Chapter of the Second Treatiſe) how located in the Figure of the Heavens, and how Aſpected benevolently or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolently by the Fortunes or Infortunes, and ſo judge according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Planet afflicting or aſſiſting your Significator, good or bad, as the ſignification and nature of the Aſpect, Planet, Sign and Houſe wherein he is denotes, and the ſignification of the Planet to which he transfers his light.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The vanity of the opinion that ♄ and ♂ are always bad, and ♃ and ♀ good.</note>As for example, in the <hi>Suns</hi> ingreſs into <hi>Aries,</hi> I have <hi>Libra</hi> aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or <hi>Aquaries</hi> or <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> located therein; I muſt not hereby, becauſe <hi>Saturn</hi> is Naturally evil, judge the condition and ſtate of the People ſignified by the Aſcendent to be evil and unfortunate this year, but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (other teſtimonies concurring) they will be in a moſt proſperous and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant condition.</p>
                        <p>For you muſt know a Planet in his own, houſe is ſtrong and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, according to the old Proverb, <hi>The Devil is good to his own Children;</hi> and ſo contrarywiſe <hi>Jupiter</hi> in my Figure at the ingreſs is in detriment and afflicted, and Significator or Planet from whence I am to inquire of ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of other Significators, which alſo concur to the ſame ſignification; muſt I from hence becauſe <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who for the moſt part is good, and in his own natural inclination free from miſchief, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or conclude the year to be fruitfull and free from any want or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury? No, but becauſe he is the Significator this year of this matter, and in detriment, retrograde, in his fall, afflicted, impotent and weak, I judge the clean contrary.</p>
                        <p>For I am to judge according to his ſignification and ability at that time not according to his natural ſignification; for otherwiſe we ſhould make moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradictions, and confound our ſelves both in judgement and reaſon, to make <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> the only Workers of iniquity; for we ſee clearly all the evils in the World are not of the Nature of theſe two, which would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow, were this admitted; but ſome are Jovial, ſome Venereal, and a third fort Mercurial, others participating of the Nature of the <hi>Sun</hi> and again of the <hi>Moon.</hi>

                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:61337:132"/>
                        <p>But to clear this point yet more fully, (for I would not have the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thus miſled in ſo groſs an errour) admit <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> bear chief Rule of the eighth houſe, which you know hath ſignification of death and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and I finde by ſeveral conſequences and reaſons in nature the Heavens do incline to ſuch miſchief: ſhall I barely becauſe one of theſe rules that Houſe conclude contrary to all found reaſon and manifeſt teſtimonies, the year will be rather healthfull? Believe it, I ſhall refuſe thus to do, for every Planet muſt perform that whereunto it is ordained; <hi>Venus</hi> is now to denote death, as being Lady of the eighth, and therefore in ſuch years I ought thus to judge.</p>
                        <p>Yet thus much I ſhall follow her nature, as to ſay there ſhall be much mortality or death amongſt the People by reaſon of voluptouſneſs, or Venery and ſuch like, becauſe ſhe hath naturally ſuch ſignification: In like manner if <hi>Jupiter</hi> be Lord of the eighth, and mortality that year denoted, I ſhall (notwithſtanding he bears rule in that part of the Heavens) thus judge as hath been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> death and mortality, but the nature thereof I ſhall take from his natural ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as by corruption of Blood, Feavers and the like, I ſhall ſay is this mortality to be occaſioned, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In the next place you are to have a ſpecial care to be well inſtructed in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every Planet and Houſe; wherefore be thou ſure to have the exact knowledge of the ſecond Treatiſe it being Introductory, before thou adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſt thus far, leaſt thou be diſcouraged from ever attaining to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſtudy, which I am certain thou wilt never do, if thou beeſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very perfect; wherefore let the firſt eight Chapters thereof be peruſed over and over, and then proceed.</p>
                        <p>Judge not upon every light teſtimony, but according to Reaſon and Art do thou order thy matter; for the more aſſurances and teſtimonies you have on any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and concurrences in cauſes, the more affirmatively may you deliver your' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
                        <p>Fear God, ſtudy Nature, follow the Rules of Art, be knowing therein, and be ignorant in the vanities of the courſe of the World, and thou ſhalt come neareſt unto Truth, and infinitely augment thy knowledge.</p>
                        <p>In your judgement of the <hi>Suns</hi> ingreſs, joyn alſo in conſideration with it, the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of Eclipſes, great Conjunctions, Comets and Blazing-ſtars, if there be any either preceding or coming after it; for be aſſured theſe things never happen but before ſome notable change and alteration in the World.</p>
                        <p>Remember that according to the Debility and ſtrength of your Significator you are to judge of the condition of any perſon, the people, or thing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thereby ſignified, and you have attained to a great help: but now leaſt you ſhould be ſtill to ſeek in the true underſtanding of the Significators ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this manner of Judgement, I ſhall (notwithſtanding what hath been delivered in the Introduction or Second Book of theſe our labours) here beneath clearly demonſtrate them unto thee.</p>

                        <p>LArgely have the Antients treated of theſe matters, yet ſome therein have come very ſhort, and to little or no purpoſe troubled their heads, leaving ſtill the Student both in doubts and errors; wherefore according to the ſincerity of my firſt undertakings, I ſhall here indeavour to undeceive my Readers touching theſe particulars, and impart unto them the truth and ſureſt rules for the judging thereof.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall firſt give you ſome of their Inſtructions, and then my own, or ſuch as I in my judgement hold to be moſt rational, that ſo thou mayſt be the better able to diſtinguiſh truth from falſhood.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Note that thoſe in Authority are underſtood by the tenth houſe, when there is no King.</note>We ſhall begin with the Significator of Kings (but you are to note that in any Nation where no ſuch are, the Grandees or chief Rulers of the times are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) the which ſay they is thus to be known or found.</p>
                        <p>Look to the Lord of the tenth houſe in your Figure at time of the Revolution of the <hi>Sun</hi> into the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi> who if he be free from Combuſtion, Retrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Impedition, and ſuch like, and within five degrees of the cuſp of the tenth, either before or after, <hi>viz.</hi> within or without the houſe, he ſhall without doubt be the Kings Significator, or chief Rulers, without any farther inquiry; but if he be any ways impedited, as in Detriment, Fall, Combuſt, Peregrine, Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, or beſieged, &amp;c. he ſhall not be ſignificator of the King or Chief Rulers.</p>
                        <p>Have recourſe then to that Planet who hath Exaltation in the Sign of the tenth, and if he be within five degrees of the cuſp (as you have heard) and in no ſort impedited or afflicted, thou ſhalt conclude him to be Significator of the King; but if he be impedited or afflicted (as aboveſaid) he ſhall not be Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator.</p>
                        <p>But now, you muſt regard the <hi>Sun,</hi> the Planet that is Almuten of the tenth, the Planet placed within five degrees of the cuſp thereof (if any ſuch be) or the Lord of <hi>Part of Government,</hi> the which if you finde (firſt beginning with the <hi>Sun</hi> and then conſidering the reſt as they are ſet down in order) placed and dignifyed eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, or free from affliction (as you have heard) he ſhall be Significator of the King, otherwiſe not.</p>

                        <p>Wherefore know, that Rich and Noblemen are ſignified by <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the Lord of the ſign in which he is located in the <hi>Sun</hi> his ingreſs into <hi>Aries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Souldiers, Armour or Standard-Bearers, Generals of Armies and the like, are underſtood by <hi>Mars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ninth houſe and the Lord thereof, denotes Clergy-men particularly, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally they are ſignified by <hi>Jupiter:</hi> Alſo Judges, and the graver ſort of men.</p>
                        <p>Students, Merchants, and Lawyers, and Scribes, Clerks, and all Pen-men, Picture-drawers, and ingenious wits; alſo youth and young men in general, are ſignified by <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Venus</hi> generally denotes women and all females (ſee chap. 5. Book the 2.) and the <hi>Moon</hi> the vulgar and rural ſort of People: as the <hi>Sun,</hi> you have heard, doth Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, all ſuch as live obſcurely and devoutly to the ſervice of God, as Monks, Abbots, Fryers, and the like, amongſt the Papiſts (as in the 1. chap. of the ſecond Book) and amongſt us ſuch as ſlight all things in the World, in compariſon of Gods Service and Divine Mediation, are ſignified by <hi>Saturn.</hi> As touching Cities and Countries ſubject both to the ſigns and Planets, you have alſo fully heard them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Second Book, where we treat of them.</p>
                        <p>Now to know the ſtate and condition of any of theſe in a general way in any Annual Revolution, you have no more to do but this; look to your ſignificator, from which judgement is to be required, and ſee if he be eſſentially or accidentally ſtrong or aſſiſted, and judge according to his ſtrength or debility good or bad to the parties ſignified; for if well dignified and located, good may be expected: if afflicted, and impedited, the contrary, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>As for example, in your figure you have (ſuppoſe) the Lord of the tenth in the ninth, by which you ſhall judge ſome ſecret treaſon or plot againſt his perſon during that Revolution, becauſe it is the twelfth from the tenth, and ſignifieth ſecret enemies and plots; But if beheld by the Lord thereof by a malitious <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> you ſhall ſay he ſhall undertake ſome Journey by which he ſhall endanger his life, or in the which ſome ſuch Perils ſhall happen; and if alſo at the ſame inſtant he be afflicted by the malevolent Aſpect of the Lord of the Eighth, which is the Fifth in the figure, no wiſe aſſiſted by the adjuvant beams of the Fortunes, thou mayſt then aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to be in great jeopardy of his life: and if other Teſtimonies concur, thou mayſt abſolutely pronounce death; for you muſt ſtill remember that according to the ſignification of the Sign the afflicting Planet is Lord of, and the Sign and place of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wherein he is, to pronounce the nature of the evil threatned; for we ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Lord of the Eighth before mentioned to be in the Seventh, which is the Fourth in the Figure, though Seventh from the Tenth, by which you may aſſuredly ſay that the evil, <hi>viz.</hi> the danger of death threatned, ſhall be occaſioned by the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and furious actions of his enemy, the Seventh houſe having ſignification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and ſo judge of any other poſition; and contrariwiſe if the Aſpects and Planets aſpecting be Fortunes, and in good places of Heaven, judge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Rules touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator of the King.</note>If the Significator of the King be under the <hi>Sun</hi> beams, there is much danger (as ſay the Arabians) of his deceaſe in that Revolution; but I ſhould rather judge his Kingly power to be then neer Death or an End, or likely to be much eclipſed, for that there are many Significators to be conſidered for the judging of Death, which ought never to be pronounced upon one bare teſtimony; beſides, were this admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we ſhould conſequently conclude by the ſame rule, the Death of a whole Senate upon ſuch a poſition in ſuch an Ingreſs, they being ſignified by the ſame ſignificator, where there is no King, which were ridiculous in any one ſo to do; but I ſay that their power and glory ſhall be eclipſed and ſhaken, and perhaps overthrown at that time when any ſuch Poſition is found.</p>
                        <p>If the Significator be not as yet under the <hi>Sun</hi> beams, but within twelve or thirteen degrees entring, then judge this Cataſtrophe to be when he comes under his beames, or in conjunction with the <hi>Sun</hi> bodily.</p>
                        <p>The ſame alſo is to be feared when the Sign of the Tenth is <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or in corporal <hi>Conjunction</hi> with him, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be Lord of the Eighth, or therein located, or in reception or tranſlation of light with the Lord of the Eighth, or with <hi>Saturn,</hi> or any Aſpect, eſpecially if he be infortunately placed in the time of his Nativity or Coronation.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe when the Lord of the year is in Combuſtion in the Tenth, this danger is threatned him in his own Dominions; but if he be thus afflicted in the Fourth or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, the danger is to be feared and expected from ſome coming out of thoſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſignified by the Sign wherein the Lord of the Year is afflicted.</p>
                        <p>Know alſo that when in any Revolution the <hi>Sun</hi> is Significator of the Rulers of any place, and in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> they ſhall be envyed and moleſted by their own Houſhold Servants and Subjects; if there be any ſuch Aſpect betwixt the Lord of the Aſcendent and Lord of the Tenth, the Common People will alſo riſe up againſt their Superiors to reject them.</p>

                        <p>But if there be any friendly aſpect betwixt them, or reception, or tranſlation of light, judge the contrary.</p>

                        <p>You have heard that the ſign of the tenth Houſe in any annual Revolution, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Lord thereof, hath ſignification of Kings and chief Rulers; the which if it be combuſt in any of the Angles, it ſignifieth deſtruction to the King or chief Rulers during that Revolutions effects.</p>
                        <p>As if it be in the Aſcendent, and the <hi>Sun</hi> be Lord thereof, you may from hence conclude (if other teſtimonies concurr) that the Common People or Subjects will riſe up againſt their Superior or Governers, and kill him or them or depoſe them, or at leaſt grievouſly moleſt and afflict them, according to the power and ſtrength of the ſignificators; for if <hi>Mars</hi> do then afflict him by <hi>Conjunction</hi> or aſpect, and be either Lord of the eighth or fifth, or therein located, death is the more to be feared; but if <hi>Saturn</hi> be then in aſpect or <hi>Conjunction</hi> with the Lord of the tenth, it is likely ſome Saturnian diſeaſe or evil will afflict his perſon if he be not Lord of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Houſes, and bear dominion either by eſſential dignity or bodily preſence in the ſixth, or elſe ſome other misfortune will befal him according to the nature of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and the place and ſign of Heaven wherein he is located.</p>
                        <p>If the Combuſtion fall out ſo as to be in the ſeventh or fourth Houſes of Heaven, Judge the miſchief to be according to the ſignification of theſe Houſes, as you have heard of the Aſcendent: for if it be in the ſeventh you ſhall ſay (becauſe it hath ſignification of the Enemies of the People) that the diſaſter ſhall be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by them; in the fourth (being the ſeventh from the tenth) from his own proper Antagoniſts, &amp;c. if in the tenth it ſelf this combuſtion be, it ſhall proceed from his own unrulineſs or wilfulneſs, &amp;c. this is clear.

                        <p>If any of the aforeſaid places or ſignificators fall in the place of any Eclipſe or great <hi>Conjunction,</hi> judge the miſchief threatned to happen according to the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Eclipſe or Planets ſo in <hi>Conjunction;</hi> warily judging according to the nature of the Houſes wherein they are in the Scheme of the Eclipſe or <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and the ſignification of their own nature, and the nature of the Houſes which they rule and are located in at the time of the Kings Coronation or Election; This you ſhall more fully underſtand in the delivering the rules of this Art touching the Judgement of Eclipſes and great <hi>Conjunctions</hi> at the latter end of this Treatiſe.</p>
                        <p>I utterly for my own part Refuſe to follow the rules of the Ancients touching their giving a year to every ſign betwixt the Planet afflicting and afflicted, for the judging the time of the alteration of any Government and the like; for that they ſtand not with much reaſon, or are they built on any ſtrong foundation, ſo as to ſtand unqueſtionable; a little experience and obſervation will ſoon manifeſt unto thee the truth hereof; for touching the juſt time when any ſuch accident ſhall
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61337:137"/>happen, I conceive ought rather (and that with a great deal of more reaſon) to be left to the good pleaſure and will of the Moſt High, who is the great orderer and diſpoſer of all the Cauſes in Nature, and will according to his own good time effect what is moſt agreeable unto his Divine will.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore let it ſuffice to know by the iuclinations of thoſe Glorious Bodies the alterations and durabilities of ſublunary things, without enquiring how or when it will be performed; if thou findeſt at the beginning of any Government or State the Angles of Heaven fixed, the Lords thereof well diſpoſed, eſpecially of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and mid-heaven, and free from the malevolent preſence and Configurations of the Infortunes, and eſſentially dignified and aſpected by the adjuvant Planets, thou mayſt from hence conclude the firmneſs and permanency of the Rule or Government then ſet up; but if thou findeſt theſe places and ſignificators contrariwiſe afflicted, moveable and weak, judge the contrary thereunto.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Saturn</hi> be then Lord of the Aſcendent, and eſſentially well dignified and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free from the affliction of the Malevolents and Angular, ſay that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, State, Rule or Government then began ſhall flouriſh and continue unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able 465 years, being the greateſt years of <hi>Saturn;</hi> and if he be not altogether ſo well placed, but free from all impediment and in a ſuccedent Houſe, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Rule then ſetled ſhall continue firm and unaltered 57 years, being his greater years; if he be ſignificator and eſſentially dignified, and free from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment aforeſaid, and in a Cadent Houſe, ſay it ſhall continue in the condition it firſt was in, 43 years and a half, being his mean years; but if he be but thus meanly placed and but moderately dignified, judge the continuance thereof to be but 30 years, which are his leaſt years; and ſo accordingly judge of all the other Planets when they are ſignificators, and well placed and dignified, as you have heard of <hi>Saturn,</hi> their greateſt, greater, mean and leaſt years being all recorded in our <hi>Introduction to the Judgement of the</hi> STARS, where the nature and ſignifications of the Planets are delivered, &amp;c.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt Chapter of this ſecond Section I have ſufficiently ſhewn the way and manner of judging the condition and ſtate of the People; yet for the better illuſtration thereof (as I have ſaid) I ſhall in this manner further enlarge my ſelf thereon.</p>
                        <p>The Aſcendent, Lord thereof, and the Planet therein poſited, but more eſpecially the Lord of the Aſcendent and the <hi>Moon</hi> are ſignificators of the Common People of any Nation, Country or Kingdom concerning which thou doeſt intend to judge by the <hi>Sun</hi> his ingreſs into the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi> the which if at that time thou findeſt well diſpoſed, fortunate, in their own dignities eſſential and in an angle, or ſuccedent, free from the aſpects of the Infortunes, it denotes the People ſhall that year be in a good condition, ſhall thrive, ſhall be ſucceſsful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, and ſhall have one gain and ſucceſs upon the neck of another; eſpecially if the Planet or Planets in Configuration with them be Fortunes or well diſpoſed, or that to which the <hi>Moon</hi> doth then apply.</p>
                        <p>If the Planet to which the Lord of the Aſcendent or the <hi>Moon</hi> doth apply or is in aſpect with be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> they ſhall be ſafe and ſecure that year, ſhall enjoy their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, ſhall be free from all manner of moleſtation, ſhall have Juſtice and good Laws executed, and ſhall be in credit and honour.</p>
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:61337:137"/>
                        <p>If it be <hi>Venus,</hi> they ſhall abound and have plenty of all things, ſhall be merry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in and enjoy pleaſure and ſufficient recreation, ſhall be neat, curious, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate Marriages: Thus you ſee we ſtill judge according to the nature of the Planet in configuration of our ſignificator, and the ſtrength of both Planets; ſee this yet further cleared and demonſtrated.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Moon</hi> at this time when ſhe is thus in aſpect with theſe Planets that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (you know) are Fortunes, be cadent, weak and no wiſe eſſentially dignified, yet ſhall the condition of the People be fortunate and good, but ſhall not ſo abound in their felicities, nor have them multiplied ſo one upon the neck of the other, as you have but now heard; and if the <hi>Moon</hi> were ſo very well fortified and dignified (as you even now heard) and apply to theſe Fortunes, being alſo as aforeſaid eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially fortified, but cadent, it ſhall ſignifie the gallant condition and ſtate of the Commons, and that they ſhall have good ſucceſs upon the neck of another, but yet not in ſo ample a manner as was before declared when they were alſo placed in Angles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The <hi>Moon</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the Fortunes weak and out of their effential dignities.</note>Alſo if theſe Fortunes be out of all eſſential dignities and weak, yet ſhall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo much benefit therefrom as to be ſafe in their perſons and in health, though not much abounding in other matters, &amp;c. Yet further obſerve but the ſubſequent rules, and the reaſons being well pondered in thy mind, thou ſhalt be fully enabled to judge of other matters and ſignificators, your rules being varied according to art and diſcretion.</p>
                        <p>If in any annual Revolution the <hi>Moon</hi> being weak and peregrine applyes to the Infortunes, being eſſentially ſtrong and well diſpoſed, it denotes miſchief, trouble and anxiety to the people, poverty, want and diſgrace, according to the nature and ſignification of the Planet ſo in configuration with her; and if the unfortunate Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net be Lord of the eighth, and be therein located, or have any dominion therein, judge the death and mortality of the People; nay even though the Infortunes were not ſo placed, and the Lord of the eighth beholding the <hi>Moon</hi> or the Lord of the Aſcendent, it ſtill portends the mortality of the People; but more particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Planet afflicting.</p>
                        <p>If it be <hi>Saturn,</hi> thou ſhalt judge the People to be afflicted and perplexed with cold Saturnian diſeaſes, ſuch as are Conſumptions, Palſies, Agues, and the like, which ſhall be the occaſion of death: if to <hi>Mars,</hi> they ſhall be hot and dry, Feavers, over-heating of the blood, &amp;c. and if then <hi>Mars</hi> ſhall happen to be in an humane ſign, there ſhall be much blood-ſhed and man-ſlaughters; and ſo much the more aſſured ſhall this judgement be, if the Aſcendent come then to the place where <hi>Mars</hi> was in at the time of the beginning of that Law, or Government, or Commonwealth, &amp;c. or to the <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> thereof, or to his place in any great <hi>Conjunction</hi> of his, going before this revolution; for in any year where thou findeſt ſuch like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations, thou mayſt aſſuredly judge Wars, Commotions and effuſion of blood to follow, eſpecially in thoſe parts ſubject to the ſign and quarter of Heaven wherein <hi>Mars</hi> was.</p>
                        <p>War may alſo be predicted when he is in an angle and ſtrong, alſo when he in any Revolution is Combuſt, or enters his Fall, or when <hi>Jupiter</hi> is in combuſtion; ſee in what part <hi>Mars</hi> is, and whether Occidental, Oriental, Meridional, or Septentrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and judge thoſe in the quarter wherein he is to overcome.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in any Revolvtion be joyned in ſignification, and in an earthy ſign, it denoteth Earthquakes in thoſe parts wherein they are; if <hi>Mars</hi> be joyned with <hi>Mercury,</hi> there ſhall be much Merchandizing.</p>
                        <p>Alſo if the <hi>Moon</hi> and the Infortunes be ſo diſpoſed and mixed together, ſo that one part is ſtrong and well dignified, and the other weak and peregrine, if ſignifieth the People ſhall change their condition during that Revolution from worſe to better, and from better to worſe, according to their ſtrength and ſignifications.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe if <hi>Part of Fortune</hi> be ſtrong or well diſpoſed, as alſo its diſpoſitor, and free from all manner of affliction, good ſucceſs ſhall be to the People; if afflicted, miſchief and loſs; judge the nature of the good or bad according to what you have been already ſhewn.</p>

                        <p>If in any Revolution <hi>Iupiter</hi> be ſignificator of the People, or <hi>Almuten</hi> of the Aſcendent, and ſtrong, the People ſhall be good, vertuous, honeſt, chaſt, juſt, and loving Juſtice, Law, and all points of equity and honeſty; but if he contrariwiſe be unfortunate, the People ſhall exerciſe Cruelty, Oppreſſion, Injuſtice, ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and break the Laws, and prove quite contrary to what you have heard: Alſo when in any Revolution <hi>Iupiter</hi> is placed in the ſeventh, or oppoſite to the Aſcendent, it ſignifieth that the People ſhall have no ſucceſs or good that Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Mars</hi> be as aforeſaid <hi>Almuten</hi> and ſtrong, &amp;c. the People ſhall be ſafe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and free from the moleſtation of all their Enemies; they ſhall overcome them and beat them all under their feet, and ſhall be in a ſucceſsful and moſt proſperous condition; but if contrariwiſe he be then weak and impedited, retrograde, combuſt, &amp;c. he denotes wars, quarrels, ſlaughters, trouble, effuſion of blood, epidemical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, feavers, hot and dry diſeaſes, many miſchiefs, and the clean contrary to what he before promiſed.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe if the <hi>Sun</hi> be as aforeſaid ſignificator and ſtrong, the People ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be in an honourable and noble condition, and many that are thereunto fit ſhall be raiſed to dignity, power and authority, according to the capacity and quality of their perſons, and be in great eſteem and favour with their King or Rulers: but if he be weak and impedited, it diminiſheth the honour of the King, and abaſeth their condition, and the People ſhall ſuffer much damage and diſgrace from their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and be tormented by them.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Venus</hi> be placed and dignified as above ſaid, the People ſhall have all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and good promiſed by her ſignification, as delights, banquets, riches, pleaſure, &amp;c. and ſhall delight themſelves with Women, and the like; if ſhe be impedited, you may judge the clean contrary, as ſadneſs, poverty and little or no mirth, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>If you find <hi>Mercury</hi> in your Figure placed as you have heard, the People ſhall gain by Merchandizing, and increaſe their riches by Traffique, ſhall love and delight in knowledge, good inſtructions and ingenious Arts and Sciences; ſhall alſo cheriſh and propagate all good Learning, and the Studious therein, and ſhall love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: but if he be afflicted and unfortunate, they ſhall ſuffer much loſs and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by contrary winds, decay of Trade and Merchandizing, and have no diſpoſition at all to any good Learning or Education; and to be ſhort, he ſignifies the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what you have but now heard.</p>
                        <p>In like manner if the <hi>Moon</hi> be well placed, and be <hi>Almuten,</hi> and eſſentially ſtrong, as hath been ſaid, the year ſhall be ſeaſonable, fortunate and fertile, and the People during that Revolution happy, ſucceſsful and in a proſperous and fortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſhall be preſerved from death, ſlaughters and ſickneſs: Alſo if ſhe be ill-affected and impedited, much damage and miſchief ſhall happen unto the People, the year ſhall be unſeaſonable, deſtructive, ſickly and unfruitful or ſcarce, by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling unſeaſonably rain and dew when no need is thereof, and withholding of it when it is requiſite and thirſted after by the earth.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe as thou haſt judged of the <hi>Moon</hi> and the Planets (in a general way, as being <hi>Almuten</hi>) mayſt thou judge of the Lord of the Aſcendent, who if he be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and well dignified and aſpected, thou mayſt judge the fortunate condition and ſtate of the Common People during that Revolution; alſo their miſ-fortune, if afflicted, impedited, &amp;c.

                        <p>And according to the Nature of the ſign will the evil fall on ſuch beaſts, as are appropriated thereunto, as if the ſign aſcending at that time be <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Capricorn,</hi> it will happen on Sheep, Hogs, Hares, Goats, &amp;c. and all leſſer Cattel for the uſe of man; if <hi>Iaurus,</hi> or the laſt fifteen degrees of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> on Cowes, Oxen, Horſes, and the greater ſort of Cattel; if in <hi>Leo,</hi> or any of the feral ſigns, on the wilde ſort of Beaſts; if in <hi>Scorpio, Cancer</hi> or <hi>Piſces,</hi> on Fiſhes and ſuch Creatures as live on the Water; if in any of the aëry ſigns, the miſchief ſhall be in the ayr, <hi>viz.</hi> it ſhall be Intemperate, Peſtilential and Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Ancients alſo ſay, that if <hi>Gemini</hi> do then aſcend, the evil will fall on young men chiefly; if <hi>Virgo,</hi> on Virgins and young women; if <hi>Libra,</hi> on men of more mature years; if in the firſt fifteen degrees of <hi>Sagittary</hi> or <hi>Aquaries,</hi> on the Antienter People; this ſhall chiefly happen to thoſe Regions, Cities and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſubject to the ſign and the part of Heaven thereby ſignified (of which you are fully informed in the 28th.

                        <p>If the Aſcendent be <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> then impedited and afflicted, the Regions and Countreys ſubject thereunto ſhall ſuffer much detriment and loſs through extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Cold, Froſt and Snow, and alſo dryneſs, whereby the fruits of the earth ſhall be deſtroyed, &amp;c. If the Aſcendent be <hi>Libra,</hi> ſuch as are thereunto allotted ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer affliction by winds, peſtilential ayr, ſickneſſes and pains in the head and reins, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Mars</hi> work or ſignifie to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>In like manner, if the Aſcendent be <hi>Gemini</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> then afflicted and weak, the Places under the power or <hi>Gemini</hi> ſhall be afflicted with corrupt ayr, and receive much hurt and loſs by winds, and the people ſhall be troubled with Head-aches and obſtructions of the Lungs and Breathing-pipes; if it be <hi>Virgo,</hi> the evil threatned will be in the Regions and Cities under it; as they ſhall ſuffer through extremity of cold and dryneſs, and in ſome ſort barrenneſs and ſcarcity, and the people ſhall have palpitations of the heart, and grief in their cheſts and bellies, unleſs it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo if <hi>Cancer</hi> aſcend, and the <hi>Moon</hi> be afflicted and weak, the People under its juriſdiction ſhall be moleſted with pains and Rheumes both in their head and breſt,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61337:139"/>and there ſhall be alſo much hurt and dammage by unuſual and exceſſive rain and moiſture if <hi>Saturn</hi> prevent it not.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Leo,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> be alſo weak, ſuch places, Cities, Nation, or Kingdoms as are ſubject thereunto ſhall ſuffer dammage through extremity of heat and drought, warm peſtilential ayr, &amp;c. the people through intemperancy and diſeaſes incident unto the heart and brain, unleſs <hi>Saturn</hi> by his coldneſs reſtrain and alter the fury thereof.</p>
                        <p>If it be <hi>Sagittary</hi> that aſcends, and <hi>Jupiter</hi> impedited, then the Regions and places under <hi>Sagittary</hi> ſhall be afflicted with infirmities in the head and legs, and theſe ſhall in the firſt half of the year be incident to the perſons of men, and in the other part to beaſts of the greater ſort, as are Horſes, Oxen, Cows, Bulls, &amp;c. If the ſign be <hi>Piſces</hi> which then aſcends, the places where it Rules ſhall ſuffer inundations, and grievous infirmities both in the head and feet, as the Gout, Dropſie, and the like, if <hi>Mercury</hi> mediate or prevent it not.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, if <hi>Capricorn</hi> aſcend, and <hi>Saturn</hi> be impedited, the places ſubject to <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> ſhall be perplexed with extream cold and dry weather, and ſterility, and the people with griefs and aches in the joynts and knees: and if <hi>Aquaries</hi> aſcend, the places ſubject thereunto ſhall ſuffer by over-moiſt ayr and high winds, and the people ſhall have many infirmities in their legs and heads, if the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> contradict it not. In the like manner mayſt thou judge the good condition of the People of any Country, and the happineſs of any place if thou findeſt the Lord of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent fortunate and free from impediment; obſerve theſe Rules, and ponder the reaſons thereof, and thou ſhalt not need any farther example or illuſtration for any other in the like Caſe.</p>
                        <p>For after the ſame manner mayſt thou alſo judge of the ſignifications of the ſecond, third, fourth and fifth houſes, and ſo of them all round the whole Heavens, by having (I ſay) regard unto the Fortitudes or Debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſigns on every Cuſp, and their Lords, &amp;c. Take notice alſo that proportionably, according to the affliction and ſtrength of every Sign and Planet, and the Signs wherein the Planets are afflicted and aſſiſted, ſhall the good or evil threatned fall on the Perſons of thoſe ſignified or their Eſtates, &amp;c. and on the Places, Regions, Cities, Towns, Countreys and Provinces ſubject to the Signs wherein the afflicted or aſſiſted Planet Falls.</p>
                        <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the judging of the true ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Common People in any Nation or Kingdom, in any Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; yet by other teſtimonies and Significators, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord of the year, and the Planet or Planets in the Aſcendent accidentally at the time of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, thou wilt have their condition farther declared and inlarged in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Diſcourſe.</p>

                        <p>USually the Ancients have found out the Lord of the year by theſe Rules fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which I ſhall cordially deliver unto thee, and that with as much plainneſs as I can, and my Judgment which of them ſtands with moſt reaſon to be followed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What events are known by the Lord of the year.</note>You muſt know that by the Lord of the year is known the condition of the whole Nation, People, and indeed every thing therein a general way to happen during the time of that Revolution, wherefore it ought warily to be conſidered and known, that ſo thou mayſt do thy work compleatly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The Rules of the Antients for finding the Lord of the year.</note>After thou haſt exactly calculated the true time (to a minute) of the <hi>Sun</hi> his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi> and haſt erected thy figure as the Heavens were then on the cuſp of every houſe, and the punctual places of the Planets therein (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to the exact time of the day) then ſee what Planet you finde in an angle; for if there be any at that time ſo located, he or ſhe ſhall be Lord or Lady of the year, or ſuch as ſhall denote the condition thereof during that Revolution; but if you ſhall finde many Planets in Angles, or one Angle, and wouldſt know which of them is to be aſſigned Lord of the year; look which of them is Lord of the hour or day, and he ſhall be choſen Lord of the year (having compared one with another, and judged by the major teſtimonies) eſpecially if he behold the Lord of the term wherein he is, or the <hi>Sun,</hi> if the Revolution be by day; or the <hi>Moon,</hi> if by night; and judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſtrength and debility good or bad as you have already been ſufficiently taught.</p>
                        <p>If you finde none of thoſe Planets in Angles Lord of the hour or day, or both, then ſee which of them is moſt Fortunate or ſtrong, and make him Lord of the year; ſee alſo which of the other Planets are joyned in ſignification with him, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſtrengths and debilities and nature do thou make a right commixture, and judge thereof.</p>
                        <p>But if at the time of your Revolution there be no Planet found in any of the Angles, ſee what Planet is in the eleventh or fifth houſes, and that Planet which is found in either of them ſhall be Lord of the year; if there be more then one, ſee that you canveſs the buſineſs, as you have heard of the Planets in Angles in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                        <p>And yet if thou findeſt none in the eleventh or fifth, ſee what are in the ninth or third, and ſay the Planet in either of them is Lord of the year, and ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly judge as you have heard: but if there be no Planets neither in theſe Houſes, ſee which of all the Planets (the <hi>Moon</hi> excepted) goes firſt out of the ſign wherein it is, for he ſhall be Lord of the year, eſpecially if he behold the Lord of the term wherein he is, or the <hi>Sun,</hi> if the Revolution be by day; or the <hi>Moon,</hi> if it be by night.</p>
                        <p>But if it happen that the <hi>Sun</hi> in a Diurnal Revolution be in any of the Angles, or the <hi>Moon</hi> in a Nocturnal, he or ſhe ſhall be then Lord or Lady (as I may ſay) of the Year. <hi>Haly</hi> alſo ſaith, that when in any Revolution it ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that the Lord of the Aſcendent be alſo Lord of the houſe wherein either of the Luminaries are, eſpecially that of the Time, he ſhall without doubt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie be Lord of the Year, and alſo ſignificator of the People.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the Rule of ſome of the Ancients for finding the Lord of the Year in any Annual Revolution, others have taught us to have regard to the Lord
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61337:140"/>of the Aſcendent, who if he be direct, free from Combuſtion, and in the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>viz</hi> within three degrees within the houſe or four without, or without ſide of the cuſp, he ſhall (without any more ado) be concluded Lord of the year, and you need not trouble your ſelf further to ſeek any other; but if he be either Combuſt or Retrograde he cannot be admitted Lord of the year.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore then you are to conſider the condition of the Planet that hath Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Aſcendent; if it be a ſign wherein any of the Planets have Exaltation, and ſee whether he be free from Combuſtion and Direct, and placed in the Aſcendent, as you have heard: for if ſo, he ſhall be Lord of the year; but if he be Retrograde or Combuſt, he ſhall not have that honour.</p>
                        <p>So that then you are to inquire whither the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> be not worthy of this Rule; for if the Revolution be by day, and the <hi>Sun</hi> have any dominion in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent he ſhall have it; if by night, and the <hi>Moon</hi> ſo dignified, it ſhall be hers; but if neither of theſe be thus, have regard to the Lord of the term of the cuſp of the Aſcendent, and ſee whether he be free and placed as you have heard of the Lord of the Aſcendent and Planet therein exalted, and if ſo, he ſhall be Lord of the year, otherways not; and then laſtly, conſider the Lord of the Triplicity, of the ſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending in the like manner, and if neither of theſe yet can be admitted Lord of the year, then you are to look whether the Lord of the tenth houſe be free from Combuſtion and Direct, and placed within three degrees within, and four without the cuſp of the tenth houſe, and if ſo, he ſhall be aſſuredly Lord of the year; but if Retrograde or Combuſt, not; and ſo you muſt conſider the Lord of the Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the tenth houſe, if there be any, and the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> the Lord of the Term of the tenth, and the Lord of the Triplicity as you have heard of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And if ſtill thou art to ſeek for the Lord of the year, have regard unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth houſe, after the ſame manner thou haſt to theſe; and then to the fourth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that to the eleventh, fifth, ninth and third; firſt conſidering the Lord of the ſign upon the cuſp of the houſe, then the Planet therein exalted, afterwards the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, the Lord of the term then, and laſtly the Lord of the Triplicity, &amp;c. and ſome of the Ancients alſo have had regard to the Lord of the face; but both that, as alſo all the reſt, I do not much eſteem, yet mayeſt thou, if thou pleaſeſt follow them, alſo all the reſt,<note place="margin">The Rules of the Ancients for finding out the Lord of the year, very Inconſiſtent with reaſon.</note> I do not much eſteem, yet mayeſt thou, ir thou pleaſeſt follow them, wherefore I would not totally omit them; for by theſe Rules you ſee there is no Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net to be admitted Lord of the year, but ſuch as are direct and free from Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment and Combuſtion, and ſo conſequently the year in every Revolution muſt always be fruitfull, and the People always ſucceſsfull, never croſſed or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, &amp;c. which we ſee repugnant both to reaſon and experiene; and therefore the Ancients in this matter are no wiſe, I ſay, conſented to by me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What is por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Lord of the year when well or ill diſpoſed.</note>For this is moſt certain, that if the Lord of the year be free from Impediment, well dignified and aſpected, the year during that Revolution ſhall be plentifull, temperate and healthfull, and the People in good condition, fortunate, ſucceſsfull, and in eſteem; but if the Lord of the year be impedited, afflicted and unfortunate, judge the contrary; eſpecially if the <hi>Moon</hi> concur in ſignification: for ſhe is ſtill to be conſidered, being a general ſignificatrix of as well all things ſublunary, as men and women.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Where the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Lord of the year ſhall be manifeſted.</note> What the Lord of the year ſignifies in any Revolution, whether good or bad, ſhalbe manifeſted chiefly in thoſe Regions and Cities ſubject to the ſign wherein he is, the Quarter of Heaven he is located in, and to the ſignification of the Planet who is Lord of the year; if the Lord of the year be unfortunated or afflicted in the Aſcendent, or aſſiſted by the Fortunes and eſſentially dignified therein, the People ſhall be ſucceſsfull or afflicted in their perſons according to the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or debility of the Significator, and the nature of the houſe: if in the ſecond, in their Subſtance; in the third, in their ſhort Journeys, Friendſhip and neighbourly Converſation; in the fourth, in their Lands, Grounds and Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; in the fiſth, in their Children, Mirth and Jollity; and ſo judge of all

                        <p>I might here ſtill run on with the Rules of the Ancients for the finding out of the Lord of the year, and inlarge this Chapter to the conſiſtence of two or three ſheets, for (omitting the ſayings of other Authors) <hi>Bonaturs</hi> alone hath no leſs then 54. ſeveral Rules or Conſiderations for the finding out thereof, but to rehearſe them all were but to tire thee and my ſelf both, to little or no purpoſe; for were they of any moment, ſhould there be as many millions as units in them, I ſhould be very willing and ready to acquaint thee therewith.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The true way of fiding the Lord of the year, according to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Author.</note>Wherefore take this ſhort, but ſure Rule, for the finding out of the Lord of the year in any Annual Revolution whatſoever; ſee what ſing aſcends, and who is Lord thereof, at the time of the <hi>Sun</hi> his ingreſs into the firſt Punctum of <hi>Aries,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muten,</hi> and let that Planet who is <hi>Almuten</hi> be Lord of the year, whether he be Combuſt or Retrograde, or both, it mattereth not; yet joyn in Judgement with him the Planet therein exalted or dignified by houſe (in the eighth Chapter of the ſecond Treatiſe you are ſufficiently taught the eſſential dignities of the Planets, and how to judge of them) as for example.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall imagine at the time of the <hi>Sun</hi> his ingreſs (being Diurnal) <hi>Aries</hi> to aſcend upon the cuſp of the firſt houſe in any horizon, and the firſt degree thereof; the Lord of <hi>Aries</hi> I finde to be <hi>Mars,</hi> who by reaſon he is therein eſſentially digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by houſe, hath five eſſential dignities therefore allowed him; the term of the cuſp being one of the firſt ſix degrees of the ſign is <hi>Jupiters,</hi> the exaltation is the <hi>Suns,</hi> who hath therefore four dignities allowed him, the Triplicity (if by day) is alſo the <hi>Suns,</hi> for which he hath alſo three dignities, which makes with the other four ſeven; then if we examine yet farther what face the cuſp is in, it being in the firſt ten degrees of the ſign, we ſhall finde it to be <hi>Mars</hi> his, for the which he hath one dignity aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, which together with the aforeſaid five, makes ſix and no more; hence then. I am to conclude the <hi>Sun</hi> to be Lord of the year being <hi>Almuten</hi> of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or the Planet bearing moſt dominion therein, whoſe dignities you ſee were ſeven; yet <hi>Mars</hi> ſhall be joyned in judgement with him, but ſtill the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhall be chief Dominator or Significator whether of good or evil, according to their ſtrength or debility, as you have already ſufficiently been informed; yet becauſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the Students in this Science ſhould be well verſt in their Rules, I ſhall yet further deliver ſome Inſtructions touching the condition of ſuch things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the Lord of the year in any Revolution, by the ſignification of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, place in the Heavens, and his configurations with the other planets, and I hope to give you any more examples in this matter, being ſo plain in this one; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then we ſhall to our buſineſs in hand.</p>

                        <p>DElivering unto you the Rules of the Ancients, for knowing of the Lord of the year in the preceding Chapter, I have fully declared unto you the general denotation of the Lord of the year, when well or ill dignified or diſpoſed in any Revolution, to which I ſhall only add theſe two or three words, and proceed to the ſignification of every particular Planet when Lord of the year and Fortunate, or afflicted.</p>
                        <p>If the Lord of the year be beheld by his Diſpoſitor (<hi>viz.</hi> the Planet in whoſe houſe or ſign he is in any Revolution) and free from Impediment; for if ſo, the People under that Revolution ſhall be in a good condition, quiet, ſecure, at peace and tranquility; alſo joyfull and pleaſant.</p>
                        <p>If the Lord of the year be not impedited, and not beheld by his Diſpoſitor, or if he be impedited and aſpected by him, judge their condition to be between both, <hi>viz</hi> what you have heard, and what follows.</p>
                        <p>For if he be impedited, and behold him not, they ſhall be ſad, ſolitary, fearfull, ſhall be moleſted with War, Trouble, and Anxiety; for thou ſhalt judge the clean contrary to what thou haſt heard.</p>
                        <p>Judge this alſo according to the Nature of the houſe wherein the Lord of the year is; for if he be in the Aſcendent, judge as you have but now heard; if in the ſecond, the good or evil ſignified ſhall happen to the ſignification of the ſecond houſe, as to the Peoples ſubſtance, aſſiſtants and friends, &amp;c. according as you have been taught in the former Chapter, and other places in this Treatiſe.</p>

                        <p>For, whatever your Planet Lord or Lady of the year denotes, whether by her or his natural Complexion, or Accidental Fortitudes, good or bad, it ſhall be chiefly manifeſt in thoſe Regions ſubject to the ſign wherein he or ſhe is, and the Countreys alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that Triplicity, but more particularly in the quarter ſignified by the ſaid Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; as for example, if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in <hi>Aries,</hi> he ſhall denote miſchief and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to all Noble, Rich and Great men (becauſe they are denoted and ſignified eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial by fiery ſigns, which alſo you have heard in the 23.

                        <p>In the fourth Chapter of the ſecond Book of this volumn, you have heard the <hi>Sun</hi> hath no latitude, neither can be Oriental, Occidental, Stationary, Retrograde or Combuſt: and therefore, if you but remember to judge according to his ſtrength eſſential and accidental in all the other ſubſequent ſigns, as you have heard the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod before, this ſhall ſuffice to be ſaid of the ſignifications of the <hi>Sun</hi> when he is Lord of the year and located in any of the twelve Signs of heaven; Wherefore let us proceed to the ſignifications of <hi>Venus</hi> when ſhe is Lady of the year and ſo poſited.</p>

                        <p>LIttle will it avail you to obſerve the Latitudes of the three inferiour Planets in this manner of Judgement as you have heard of the Superiors as ſay moſt of the Ancients: and truly in this I do agree with them (though not in in many other of their tenets, eſpecially in their Rules in the laſt Chapter, where they would teach the ſignifications of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the 12. Signs in Annual Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when it is impoſsible for him at ſuch a time to be in any other ſign then <hi>Aries;</hi> and if the Judgement be half yearly, or quarterly in <hi>Libra; Cancer,</hi> or <hi>Capricorn,</hi> he muſt needs be but in no other) for oftentimes we ſhall finde the Rules in the inferiour Planets vary and prove falſe by reaſon of their ſwift motion and frequent variations but in the ſuperiour ſeldom or never; This I thought good to prefix before our Diſcourſe of the inferiour Planets that it might not ſeem ſtrange to the diligent Inquirer we follow not the ſame Method in theſe as in the former.</p>

                           </note>When <hi>Venus</hi> then is Lady of the year and in <hi>Aries</hi> in any Annual Revolution well aſpected and in Configuration of none of the Malevolents and neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde nor Combuſt, the ayr ſhall be temperate, the Earth fruitful, men in general ſucceſsful, ſhall thive, be merry and delight in all pleaſant recreations, it ſhall alſo be well with Great and noble men, and with the ſmaller ſort of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, men ſhall be peaceably given, and many pleaſant moderate ſhowers of rain ſhall fall, and generally there ſhall be plenty of proviſions, and theſe ſhall chiefly be in the Eaſtern parts, and thoſe Cities, Regions and Countreys ſubject unto <hi>Aries.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">Notes.</note> But to ſpeak the truth, I ſee no reaſon at all why <hi>Venus</hi> ſhould occaſion ſo much good in <hi>Aries,</hi> it being a ſign wherein ſhe ſuffers detriment and affliction, although no wiſe aſpected by the malevolents, and although ſhe be naturally of her ſelf fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and good, yet it will not follow (I conceive) that ſhe is of the ſame power to effect good when ſhe is weak and impotent, as when ſhe is ſtrong, for ſhe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe no more then this you have heard, when ſhe is well dignified and in <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> or <hi>Libra</hi> which are her own Houſes, and wherein ſhe is eſſentially ſtrong and dignified; a poor weak fellow in another mans power and conſtraint without arms (there is no man but knows) is not ſo able to reſcue or aſſiſt his friend, as one that is ſtrong, at liberty, and a good Sword, or Rapier at his command.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I muſt needs diſſent from the Ancients in this point; for it is not the Nature of a Planet ſimply that muſt be the ground on which we muſt judge good or bad, for then <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> ſhall never be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of miſchief in what ever houſe or ſign they are placed; the which to affirm were ridiculous and very erronious, but this you have already ſufficiently heard cleared; I ſhould therefore ſay when any benevolent Planet is thus poſited in any ſign wherein he ſuffers detriment or any other affliction, that the evil threatened will not be altogether ſo bad as was likely becauſe the benevolency of the Planet doth contradict it; nor the good altogether ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, by reaſon the Planet ſignifying it, is in detriment or otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; and therefore in ſuch poſitions as are theſe, let not the Rules of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and Tradition, lead you wholly beyond the bonds of reaſon and ſenſe for thereby you ſhall not avoid rendring your ſelf both irrational, weak and ſenſeleſs.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Containing the Significations of the <hi>Moon,</hi> when ſhe is Lady of the Year in any of the twelve Signs.</head>
                        <p>ALL that I have ſaid from the 15. Chapter of this ſecond Section hath been but (in a manner) meerly reiterations, and an inlargement of ſuch rules as were more briefly delivered before, that the Students in this Art might be very well verſed in their rules, and perfected in the reaſons and grounds thereof.</p>
                        <p>It reſteth therefore now we alſo handle the ſignifications of the <hi>Moon</hi> in every one of the twelve Celeſtial ſigns when ſhe is Lady of the year; but I muſt confeſs I am almoſt tired and wearied out with this kinde of repetition; wherefore I ſhall only in leſs bounds, [yet as largely and plainly as the Ancients for matter of Inſtruction,] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto you the ground of theſe rules, and ſo proceed to the ſignifications of the <hi>Dragons Head</hi> and <hi>Tail.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Know then that the <hi>Moon</hi> (as you have heard in the 5. Chapter of this ſecond Section) doth denote all the good that can poſsibly be deſired to the Commons and People in general when ſhe is Lady of the year and ſtrong or well dignified; if ſhe be weak, the contrary according to her debility and impediment you are to judge.</p>
                        <p>Well then when you ſee in your figure ſhe is ſtrong either eſſentially or accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, look to the Nature of the ſign ſhe is in, and artificially commixing their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and their ſtrength therein, judge thou good to ſuch things and places as are by her and the ſign ſhe is in ſignified or underſtood either naturally or accidentally as they are placed in the Heavens, according as you have heard ſufficiently before; if ſhe be weak, judge the contrary after the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>For you muſt remember that the <hi>Moon</hi> in humane ſigns ſhews her events whether good or bad on mankinde, according to the Sex of the ſign ſhe is in; if in aëry ſigns in the ayr; in watry, in the water; in earthy, in the earth; in beſtial in and upon beaſts of the nature and quality of the ſign; as if it be <hi>Aries,</hi> on ſheep; <hi>Capricorn,</hi> on Goats; <hi>Taurus,</hi> on Bulls, Cows, Oxen and the greater ſort of Cattel, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Neither oughteſt thou to forget to make commixtures according to the nature of the Planets in configuration or <hi>Conjunction</hi> with her at the time of the Revolution; for upon the true and exact commixtures (which you have been ſhewn in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Planets, and therefore needleſs here again to make repetition) dependeth the whole ſecret and key of the Art, and therefore let me here admoniſh thee once more (although I have often already) to be perfect in the nature and temperature of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Planet, every ſign, every aſpect, every houſe, every dignity, every Triplicity, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exaltation, every term, every face, every detriment, every fall, every eſſential dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and debility of every Planet in every Sign, and then thou haſt attained above half the Art, nay three parts and three quarters (being divided into four) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the ſecond Treatiſe intituled <hi>An Introduction to the Judgement of the Stars,</hi> be read over and over, which will perfect thee in theſe particulars, ſo mayſt thou bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venter upon theſe two other Treatiſes, which will then be moſt eaſily comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the greateſt myſteries therein quickly attained.</p>
                        <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſaid of the ſignifications of the ſeven Celeſtial Planets in the 12 ſigns when they are Lords or Ladies of the year; the ſame alſo ſhould ſerve for Rules to the judging the Portencies of the <hi>Dragors head</hi> and <hi>Dragons tail,</hi> but that perhaps (their natures having not been before diſcuſſed, ſo much as have the Planets) they might remain obſcure, and the knowledge of the young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents therein defective; wherefore I ſhall yet ſpend one quarter of a ſheet more for their further inſtruction in this matter.</p>

                        <p>UNleſs I here remove a ſeeming obſtruction or ſtumbling block, perhaps ſome miſtakes or errours might ariſe much to the dammage and puzzeling of the younger Student; which is this; In the foregoing Chapter you have heard the ſignifications of the Planets (eſpecially the Superiour) when in any Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they are in the point of their proper exaltations; but in this Chapter when we ſpeak of their being exalted one above the other, we mean as to their places in the Heavens at the time of the <hi>Sun</hi> his ingreſs into <hi>Aries;</hi> for he or ſhe that is neareſt to the Cuſpe of the mid-heaven or tenth houſe, is the Planet moſt elevated or exalted, and ſhall have ſignification as followeth; yet note that it is not meant barely by the poſition of one above the other at that time, but when any two are in <hi>Conjunction</hi> or other Configuration and elevated the one above the other at that time, then I ſay ſhall their ſignifications be as is here expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to the Ancients who begin in this matter with <hi>Venus,</hi> I ſhall as all along I have done begin with <hi>Saturn,</hi> and ſo give you their ſignifications ſtill in order as they are placed in the Heavens; as <hi>Saturn</hi> being in <hi>Conjunction, Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> with any Planet, the <hi>Dragons Head,</hi> and <hi>Tail,</hi> or <hi>Blazing Star,</hi> and exalted above them, we ſhall begin thus: <hi>Saturn</hi> exalted above <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and then above <hi>Mars,</hi> and afterwards above the <hi>Sun</hi> and ſo forwards; and not as the Ancients have done who ſet down his ſignifications as he is exalted above the <hi>Moon</hi> firſt, then above <hi>Iupiter,</hi> then <hi>Mars,</hi> then <hi>Dragons Head, Dragons Tail, Blazing-Star,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Venus;</hi> omitting his ſignifications when in any Configuration of <hi>Mercury</hi> or the <hi>Sun,</hi> and exalted above them; which defect as in this, ſo in the ſignification of the other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, I ſhall endeavour to ſupply; for in the ſignifications of <hi>Venus</hi> they have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Dragons Head;</hi> and a <hi>Blazing-Star</hi> in the ſignifications of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> in the ſignifications of <hi>Mars;</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> alſo, of the <hi>Dragons Head, Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>DIligently thou art to obſerve whether the Revolution in any year be by night or by day, <hi>viz.</hi> Diurnal or Nocturnal; and if it be Diurnal, have regard to the <hi>Sun,</hi>

                        <p>For if the <hi>Sun</hi> be ſtrong and well dignified and aſpected, he ſignifies (the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being Diurnal) the accompliſhment of ſome high and remarkable action; ſee alſo if the Lord of the then Aſcendent be ſtrong eſſentially, and accidentally well aſpected; for if ſo, he ſhall ſignifie proſperity, health and happineſs during that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution to thoſe Regions, Cities, Towns and Places ſubject to the ſign which is then upon the Cuſpe of the Aſcendent, alſo to that Kingdom or Nation for which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution is made, and the Kingdoms, Regions and Places ſubject to the Lord of the Aſcendent; but if he be weak, afflicted and impedited, he ſhall ſignifie trouble, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, miſery, detriment and very much unhappineſs (according to the quantity and quality of his affliction) unto thoſe aforeſaid places ſubject to the Lord of the Aſcendent and ſign thereof.</p>

                        <p>As for example, we ſhall ſuppoſe your ſignificator to be the Lord of Year or Aſcendent, the Planet afflicting to be <hi>Mars</hi> and he Lord of the ſeventh and located in the ſecond; from hence you ſhall conclude that the people of the Nation for which the Revolution is made, ſignified by the Lord of the Year or Aſcendent, ſhall be afflicted and damnified in their eſtates and riches, being afflicted in or from the ſecond houſe (which you know denotes the wealth and riches of the people) therefore from hence ſhall the evil or miſchief threatned proceed: Now as touching the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, or manner how it ſhall come to paſs, you ſhall ſay it ſhall be by the ſword, thefts, wars, murthers and the like, which are the natural ſignifications of <hi>Mars;</hi> or elſe by the power or treacherous plots of their Enemies, which is his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental ſignification as being Lord of the ſeventh, which you have heard is the houſe of Enemies, &amp;c. or if the ſign of the ſecond be <hi>Libra,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> therein, look to his ſignifications in <hi>Libra,</hi> as you have been taught in the ſeventeenth Chapter of the ſecond Section of this ſame Treatiſe and ſay it ſhall be occaſioned ſo and ſo as you have it there expreſſed; in like manner if it be any other ſign or any other Planet, judge according as you ſhall ſee moſt requiſite and agreeing to art and nature; if the afflicting Planet be in the third, the evil ſhall proceed from ſhort journies, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, kindred, or brothers and ſiſters or aſſociates; if in the fourth, from fathers, heritages, loſs of poſſeſſions, houſes, farms, or deſtruction of ſeed and fruits, &amp;c. judge ſtill according to the nature of the houſe wherein your afflictor ſhall be found, which you have been taught elſewhere ſufficiently.</p>

                        <p>The affairs alſo of the King or Grandees of the Nation where your Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and their condition ſhall be bad and ſuffer detriment, and much trouble and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty there ſhall be in or about them, and they ſhall require aid and aſſiſtance from the common people, Religion ſhall be ſlingted and impiety and wickedneſs ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe amongſt men, and no mercy or pity ſhall be found amongſt them, and this ſhall continue till either <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> tranſite the cuſp of the tenth Houſe at time of the Revolution, or ſhall then begin ad continue, at leaſt till <hi>Mars</hi> have made one Revolution through the twelve Signs of the Zodiack.</p>
                        <p>But if then <hi>Saturn</hi> be in <hi>Virgo</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> Aſpect him out of <hi>Gemini</hi> (as hath been ſaid) and the <hi>Moon</hi> alſo tranſlate her light to <hi>Saturn</hi> and ſhe in <hi>Sagittarie,</hi> there ſhall be miſery upon miſery, the miſchief of miſchiefs, the trouble of troubles, the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of tribulations, the peſtilence of peſtilencies, and the misfortune of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and all kind of vexations, troubles and torments, alſo it ſignifies the deſtruction of Kingdoms, and tranſlation of one Kingdome into the power and under the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of another.</p>
                        <p>Moreover if the <hi>Moon</hi> when ſhe tranſlates her light and nature to <hi>Saturn,</hi> either by <hi>Conjunction, Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> and the Lord of the Sign wherein ſhe is when there is a Partil <hi>Conjunction, Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> betwixt them, be then impedited, unfortunate, weak or afflicted, there ſhall be many diverſities of miſchiefs during the time of that Revolution; and if then the <hi>Moon</hi> were eclipſed at the Preventional, or to be eclipſed at the Poſtventional full <hi>Moon</hi>
                           <pb n="279" facs="tcp:61337:163"/>immediately going before or comming after any ſuch Configuration, the miſchiefs and troubles threatned ſhall continue ſo many moneths as the <hi>Moon</hi> is or ſhall be ecclipſed houres, reckoning from the minute ſhe firſt begins to be ecclipſed till the Punctum wherein ſhe is again free.</p>
                        <p>But if <hi>Part of Fortune</hi> be Impedited, and its diſpoſitor when the <hi>Moon</hi> is ſo in <hi>Conjunction</hi> or aſpect partil of <hi>Saturn,</hi> the evill thereby ſignified or threatned ſhall be increaſed; have regard alſo to the <hi>Sun</hi> how he is placed, dignified and aſpected by the Malevolent Planet, or by what Aſpect he beholds him, (as you have heard of the <hi>Moon</hi>) and the Lord of the Sign in which he is at the time of the Partil <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> or Aſpect, and make <hi>Part of Fortune</hi> and its Diſpoſitor participate in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification therewith, and judge accordingly <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> as you have heard (I ſay) of the <hi>Moon;</hi> and if the <hi>Sun</hi> was eclipſed, or to be eclipſed at the Preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or Poſtventional <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the Luminaries or change of the <hi>Moon</hi> (to ſpeak plainly) the evill then threatned ſhall continue ſo many years as the <hi>Sun</hi> is at that time eclipſed houres.</p>
                        <p>Alſo when any Planets behold one another, and be in any Reception, look in what place in the figure they project their rays or beams; for thoſe places ſubject to the ſign wherein they caſt their rayes, ſhall ſuffer ſuch things as are by thoſe Planets ſignified, whether good or bad, more then any other place.</p>
                        <p>And if one planet transfer his light, Nature and Vertue to another, you are diligently to weigh their natures and ſignifications, and judge accordingly as you have been before ſufficiently ſhown; as if the Significator of the King transfer his light and Nature to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and he alſo well diſpoſed, ſuch people and religious orders and things which you have heard elſewhere ſignified by <hi>Saturn,</hi> ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and receive good from the bounty or liberality of the King or Superiours; If to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Nobles, Judges, and ſuch as converſe in the Law, and are ſignified by him, ſhall receive honour, liberty, and much good from the Kings hand, &amp;c. And ſo judge if any other Planet and if any other Significator transfer his light to any, remember the Nature of your Significator; transfering his light, and the Natural and Accidental ſignification of the Planet to whom it is transferred, and judge according thereunto and you are right, and will ſoon be able to judge of any matter <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> varying your rules according to Art.</p>
                        <p>And thus far have I in a manner reiterated rules and words for thy through underſtanding and inſtruction in ſuch matters as have been delivered in a more ſhort and compendious manner before, and indeed ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that though what was at the beginning of this Diſcourſe ſet down, was ſufficient to and for any one that is any thing entred into this Art, yet would it perhaps have ſeemed ſomewhat difficult to thoſe who are as yet altogether unſeen therein, and therefore I hope this fault will be by the Judicious deemed venial; Wherefore let us now proceed.</p>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61337:164"/>each other, or applying to each other by any of theſe Configurations, wars are to be feared, and that they ſhall then begin when they are in <hi>Partil Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect, if they are in Angles, or elſe they ſhall begin when <hi>Jupiter</hi> enters his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation or one of his houſes, or any of the Angles of the Figure at time of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and judge that party to have Victory that is ſignified by the Planet moſt elevated in his excentrick; for if <hi>Jupiter</hi> be moſt elevated, and be exalted above <hi>Saturn,</hi> they ſhall overcome who make inſurrection or begin the ſtrife.</p>
                        <p>Alſo if <hi>Mars</hi> be in any of the Angles at time of the Revolution, whichſoever it be, he excites and ſtirs up wars according to his ſtrength and power; for if he be ſtrong and well dignified, it will be the more certain, alſo the ſtrife and war will be the more invective and grievous; in like manner if he be in a <hi>Square</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter,</hi> becauſe theſe are the Superior Planets; for take this for an approved Aphoriſm, that when any of the Superiors, <hi>viz.

                        <p>A <hi>Tabarim</hi> amongſt other of the Antients hath been herein moſt large; what is moſt expedient to be known, I ſhall here ſet down, and as neer as I can omit that which may be ſuperfluous</p>
                        <p>In this manner of judgement, you are to have regard to the ingreſs of the <hi>Sun</hi> into <hi>Aries,</hi> from whence you are to require Judgement, as alſo of the Poſition of the Heavens at every <hi>Conjunction</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of the Luminaries every moneth, and from the <hi>Conjunction</hi> preceding every Ingreſs, as well quarterly and half-yearly as yearly, for all things happening in this World in a natural way, are occaſioned by the Stars, and may be known by the Poſition of the Heavens, Stars and Planets at the time of the <hi>Conjunction</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of the Luminaries if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſo that by the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> the Generation and beginning of things are judged, by the <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> the deſtruction and decay thereof; for the <hi>Moon</hi> being neereſt of all the Planets to the Globe of the Earth, and the ſwifteſt, doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately convey unto it and men thereon the vertue and ſignification of all the other Planets, and therefore we ſee by reaſon of this her great power and influence, all things, as well Vegetatives and Minerals as Animals, increaſe and decreaſe in vigour ſtrength and growth in ſome ſenſe according to her motion, and that the corruption and generation of all things are appropriate unto her and the <hi>Sun,</hi> and therefore by their <hi>Conjunction</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition</hi> theſe things may perfectly be known unto us if we be but ſearchers and contemplators of Nature and its Cauſes.</p>
                        <p>Now if thou wouldſt know what ſhall happen generally touching the price of any thing in any year, have regard unto the Poſition of the Heavens at the <hi>Suns</hi> Ingreſs into <hi>Aries</hi> if there be but one figure to be erected, but if two look to their Poſitions at his Ingreſs into <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra,</hi> if four, or for every quarter, at his Ingreſs into <hi>Aries, Cancer, Librae,</hi> and <hi>Capricorn;</hi> and if you would more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly make monethly obſervations thereon, have regard unto the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the Luminaries every moneth; and remember that the Aſcendent thereof, or the ſign aſcending at that inſtant for which you deſire to erect the figure of the Heavens, its Lord and the Planet or Planets therein located are ſignificators of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtate of Man and the Ayr, and you may join alſo in ſignification with them the Diſpoſitor of the Lord of the Aſcendent, if the Planets or Planet therein located be peregrine and afflicted, judge miſchief and detriment in theſe according to his nature, ſignification and ſtrength; and ſo judge the contrary if he be then ſtrong and eſſentially dignified.</p>
                        <p>If there be any Planet in an Angle who hath dignity and power in the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, eſpecially Exaltation, he ſhall be the Significator of the price of things, or any Planet in an Angle Eſſentially dignified and ſtrong; and if the Lord of the Aſcendent be remote from this Houſe and the Planet in an Angle Peregrine, yet he ſhall be Significator as long as he is in that Angle; But when the Lord of the Aſcendent is in any of the Angles, or in the eleventh or fifth Houſes, he ſhall more manifeſtly ſhew his ſignifications then any other, eſpecially if he be Oriental and going from under the <hi>Sun</hi>-beams: ever take this for a general and true rule, that what ever Planet you finde fortunate in any ſign,<label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                           </label> he ſhall ſignifie and denote the dearneſs of ſuch things as are under the ſignification of that Planet, and the ſign wherein he is; ſo alſo on the contrary, if he be weak and impedited, judge they will be of little or no eſteem or value, and may be purchaſed at a ſmall rate; wherefore it is very neceſſary you be throughly verſed in the Nature of every Planet and Sign which you are ſufficiently taught in the ſecond Book; and this rule without any more
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61337:167"/>words may ſuffice for ſufficient inſtruction in theſe matters, yet may we apply it thus</p>
                        <p>Look if the Lord of your Aſcendent be received or diſpoſed of by any Planet and the receiving or diſpoſing Planet be ſtrong in an Angle, it ſignifieth that Corn and ſuch things as are moſt neceſſary for the uſe of man ſhall be at a high rate all that moneth; And the Diſpoſitor of the Lord of the Aſcendent in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries or that of the time promiſeth the ſame; as alſo if the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be received or diſpoſed of, and he together with the receiving and diſpoſing Planet be aſcending; But if the Lord of the Aſcendent and the Planet in an Angle apply to any Planet Cadent, ſlow in motion, or afflicted, the price ſhall fall; ſo likewiſe if the Lord of the Aſcendent, its Receptor or Diſpoſitor be Cadent, weak and afflicted it ſignifieth the ſame, according to their affliction; if much weakned and afflicted, they will be very cheap, if a little afflicted their price will fall but not altogether ſo much &amp;c. And if the Lord of the Aſcendent, its Diſpoſitor and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor do then alſo apply to any Planets weak, cadent and afflicted, this will be the more certain.</p>
                        <p>See alſo what Planet you finde in the Aſcendent, for he ſhall have ſignification with the Lord of the Aſcendent, and ſhall according to his ſtrength or weakneſs denote the cheapneſs or dearneſs of proviſions; But if the Lord of the Aſcendent be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any Planet, he ſhall not have ſignification with him, but the Planet therein placed ſhall be Significator onely: If your Significator, or Lord of the Aſcendent, (if he have participation with him) and the Luminaries be in the Aſcendent, or in any other Angle at the time of their monthly <hi>Conjunction,</hi> the price of Corn &amp; other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the life of man ſhal-continue and remain as it was in the preceding moneth; but if your Significator and the Luminaries be received and ſtrong, and be in the eleventh, or fifth, the price ſhall be raiſed, and that according to their fortitudes; for if they be eſſentially very ſtrong it will be much raiſed, and ſo on the contrary: Alſo if the Planet in the Aſcendent apply unto the Lord of the Aſcendent, the price ſhall be raiſed that day you finde your ſignificators in Partil <hi>Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect; but if the Lord of the Aſcendent and the Luminaries be weak and afflicted in the third, or ninth, or twelfth, or eighth Houſes, it ſignifieth their price ſhall be abated and fal'n; But the Angles ſignifie the fixation and durability of what is; If any afflicted Planet alſo apply to the Lord of the Aſcendent, judge the abatement of the price, and that eſpecially if the Lord of the Aſcendent apply to any Planet weak or afflicted.</p>
                        <p>Moreover if the Lord of the Aſcendent be weak and afflicted, and its Diſpoſitor ſtrong, yet ſhal not he by his ſtrength ſignifie any thing; for the Lord of the Aſcendent ſhall ſtil be Significator of the price of things unleſs he were in a Cadent Houſe, and ſome Planet be then in an Angle (as hath been ſaid) for then that Planet ſhall be Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator: Laſtly, if the Aſcendent be any of the houſes of the Luminaries, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto them, and according to their fortitudes or debilities and places in the figure and Configuration with the Aſcendent, judge.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Antients have taught that we are to regard the Planet in the tenth Houſe, if any be there at the time of the <hi>Sun</hi> this ingreſs into <hi>Aries,</hi> or the Planet applying to the Lord of the tenth, and make him ſignificator of the price of things; As if the Planet located in the tenth or beholding the Lord thereof be ſtrong and direct, ſuch things ſignified by the ſign wherein your Significator is ſhall be deer and of an high price; but if your Significator be weak and retrograde, judge the contrary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dorotheus</hi> with others ſay to know the price of things, look what Planets you find at the <hi>Sun</hi> his ingreſs into <hi>Aries</hi> Oriental, and judge ſuch things ſignified by him, and the ſign wherein he is ſhall be deer; and that thoſe that are under the ſignification of thoſe that are Occidental and the ſigns wherein they are, ſhall be cheap; In like manner have regard to every Planet, and ſee which of them is ſtrong and free from all impediment, and judge ſuch things as are ſignified by him and the ſign wherein he is, ſhall be deer, and on the contrary they ſhall be cheap whoſe Significators are
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61337:167"/>weak, combuſt, cadent, under the <hi>Sun</hi>-beams and Retrograde, &amp;c. and ſo alſo according to their mean betwixt thoſe two extreams judge of the buſineſs when they are not altogether ſo ſtrong, nor altogether ſo weak; and truly this is very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and for the generality may paſs current, yet mayeſt thou follow which moſt pleaſeth thy fancy, but I would recommend this unto thee.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Abrahamus Judaeus</hi> ſaith, If <hi>Saturn</hi> in any Revolution or other time be not in any of the angles, ſuch things as are edible and moſt beneficial and uſeful for man ſhall be cheap; but if he be therein, judge the contrary, eſpecially if he be ſtrong and have dignity therein, for then he ſhall denote grievous penury and want, things ſhall be ſo deer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Meſſehalah</hi> ſaith, have reſpect unto the Lord of the Aſcendent and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and if the ſtrongeſt of them apply to any Planet in the Aſcendent or Mid-heaven, judge the price of proviſions neceſſary for the uſe of man to be high; and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to any Planet in the ſeventh houſe the price ſhall be indifferent; but if to a Planet in the fourth, received or the Lord of the Aſcendent, its Diſpoſitor, or the <hi>Moon</hi> received by him, it ſhall be high; but if they or either of them apply to a Planet in a cadent houſe not receiving him, proviſion ſhall be ſo bad it will hardly be ſold; but if they do receive him, they ſhall be deer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Haly</hi> ſaith, have regard to the Lord of the Year who if he be going to Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation or be Deſcending in his circle, or be in the lower part of his Epicycle, he ſignifieth things ſhall be cheap and of a low price that are of the nature of the ſign wherein he is; ſo likewiſe if the <hi>Moon</hi> be either in the Revolution of the year, quarter or moneth decreaſing in light and motion, or applying to a Retrograde or weak Planet, ſhe ſignifieth the ſame.</p>
                        <p>But as touching the cheapneſs and dearneſs of any thing, have regard to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the <hi>Sun</hi> into <hi>Aries,</hi> or any other quarter (if it be ſo that ſo many figures are to be made) and therein diligently conſider the ſtate and condition of the Planet and Sign ſignifying that concerning which you would require judgement, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſtrength and debility judge; for if ſtrong, the things will be deer and of an high price or value; and if weak, judge the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Antients have alſo taught that for monethly obſervations in this matter we have regard to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the Luminaries, and <hi>Haly</hi> ſaith that we ought in every year to have regard whither <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> enter the ſign of the Kingdom, Nation or Countrey for which you erect your Figure, and from their then places, ſtrengths and debilities we are to judge; for that if the Planets are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in theſe places, it ſignifies things ſhall be cheap; but if they be there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunated and ſtrong, judge the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Moreover you are to take notice that every Planet in his Exaltation or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in his Epicycle whether he have dignity in the Aſcendent or no, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth things ſhall be deer that are of the nature of that Planet and the Sign wherein he is; and therefore I ſay again it is moſt requiſite you be throughly acquainted with the ſignifications of the Planets and Signs taught you in the ſecond Book.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Teaching by other Rules how to judge of the alteration of the Ayr, and to know when Rain is to be expected.</head>
                        <p>YOu muſt ſtill remember to erect your Figure for the exact time for which you require judgement, and place the Planets therein being (reduced to the time of the day) and ſee what Planets are then in <hi>Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect with the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> eſpecially if the figure be made at any Lunation, for if it be <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> and they corporally joined to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> in a <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> of them, and they be then free from the <hi>Conjunction</hi> and Aſpect of all the Malevolents, neither apply unto them after their ſeparation from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> it is an aſſured teſtimony of fair weather; but if <hi>Jupiter</hi> behold them by a <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> and they free alſo from the Malevolent Configurations of the Infortunes (as hath been ſaid) he ſhall denote gentle pleaſant ſhewers. But if any of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent Planets, eſpecially <hi>Saturn</hi> be in Aſpect with them, or <hi>Conjunction,</hi> although by <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine,</hi> or they apply unto him after their <hi>Conjunction,</hi> eſpecially if by <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> rain ſhall inevitably follow, for it is the natural property of the Malevolents to diſturb and thicken the Ayr with offenſive groſs vapours, as it is the diſpoſition of the fortunes to diſperſe them and clear the ayr thereof, reſiſting the quality of the Malevolents.</p>
                        <p>Now you muſt know, that although <hi>Venus</hi> be one of the fortunes, yet doth ſhe by reaſon of her moiſt nature diſpoſe the ayr and weather to moiſture, eſpecially if ſhe be in any Configuration with the <hi>Sun</hi> in moiſt ſigns and manſions, or have any commixture or participation with the malevolents, but yet ſhe ſeldome ſends noiſome or unſeaſonable wet weather, unleſs, when ſhe participates with the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſhe be then alſo very weak and afflicted, for then ſhe is not able to leſſen their malicious influence.</p>
                        <p>If the <hi>Sun</hi> be in the South part of heaven and <hi>Venus</hi> under his beams, and the <hi>Moon</hi> be then in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with either of them, eſpecially with <hi>Venus,</hi> or apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto her by any Aſpect, you ſhall aſſuredly judge when that Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>viz.</hi> that very day and hour there ſhall be rain and ſhewers, and if then <hi>Mercury</hi> alſo be in the ſame part of Heaven applying to the <hi>Moon</hi> by <hi>Conjunction</hi> or Aſpect, it ſhall prenote rain, eſpecially if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Scorpio:</hi> ſo alſo if <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> be in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> eſpecially alſo in <hi>Scorpio;</hi> and when the <hi>Sun</hi> is in <hi>Aquaries</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> applying by <hi>Oppoſition</hi> unto him, and <hi>Venus</hi> be alſo placed as aforeſaid, you ſhall judge rain at that very hour, ſo alſo when <hi>Mars</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes at that time to either the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and when <hi>Venus</hi> applyes unto the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> then alſo in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> with her or ſhe with him, rain is to he expected at that very inſtant; again, if the <hi>Sun</hi> be in <hi>Libra,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Sagittarius</hi> in the ſame number of degrees, and the <hi>Moon</hi> applying, eſpecially to <hi>Venus,</hi> that very day and hour you may predict rain; alſo when the <hi>Sun</hi> is either in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Aquaries</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> unto him many ſhewers follow in that day from the hour of their <hi>Oppoſition;</hi> judge the ſame if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Sagitary,</hi> yet <hi>Leo</hi> is a cauſe of more ſhewers a great deal; alſo if the aforeſaid Configurations be out of the houſes of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> judge the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> wet-weather, alſo thunder, lightning, rain in great drops, and ſometimes hail: Again, if the <hi>Sun</hi> be in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Piſces,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Libra</hi> or <hi>Virgo,</hi> or <hi>Sagittary,</hi> there ſhall be ſhewers in that hour wherein they come to a Partil <hi>Oppoſition</hi> or <hi>Square;</hi> In like manner if <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in any of the aforeſaid places behold the <hi>Sun</hi> out of <hi>Leo,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi>

                        <p>But you are here to note that there are ſome places of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> called <hi>Places of rain,</hi> and again others which are not altogether ſo effectual; thoſe which moſt conduce and incline to rain, are <hi>Cancer, Leo, Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Aquaries,</hi> for if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in any of them and corporally joined to <hi>Venus,</hi> or by any Aſpect doth participate of her nature, and their beams touch each other within one degree either before or after the Partil <hi>Conjunction,</hi> or Aſpect, eſpecially if the Aſpect be a <hi>Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> there ſhall follow many ſhewers, but you are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the firſt 15 degrees of <hi>Capricorn</hi> is leſs effectual, or conduceth leaſt to rain of any of the other, and the laſt fifteen degrees inclines rather to cold, ſo that you are warily to judge according to diſcretion; thoſe places that are leſs effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual are the laſt term of <hi>Aries,</hi> and the ſigns <hi>Gemini, Virgo</hi> and <hi>Libra.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>So that if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in any of the Angles from the Aſcendent or in any of the Angles from the Lord of the Aſcendent, ſtrong and eſſentially dignified, eſpecially in the mid Heaven, he ſignifies a various and divers temper of Ayr, thick and dark clowds; and in hot weather he leſſeneth the heat, and in winter or cold weather the cold is by him augmented and increaſed; but if he be not in an Angle, the times ſhall be more ſtable and natural; alſo if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in any of the Angles from the Lord of the Aſcendent, he ſhall not work ſo forcibly his effects as when he is in any Angle from the Aſcendent it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>And if <hi>Mars</hi> be located as you have heard of <hi>Saturn,</hi> eſpecially in the mid-Heavens, the heat in Summer ſhall be increaſed and augmented, and the cold in Winter diminiſhed and abated, and the Spring and Autumn alſo ſhall incline rather to heat then cold.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Jupiter, Venus</hi> or the <hi>Moon</hi> be ſo placed, they cauſe a temperate, good and wholeſome ayr, and cauſe every thing to grow, increaſe and fructifie well and kindely that is ſown or planted in the Earth.</p>
                        <p>Again, If <hi>Mercury</hi> be found as aforeſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> in the mid-Heaven in the figure of the Preventional <hi>Conjunction</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> in an aiery ſign and any of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in any of his Angles, it denotes much change of Ayr, great and high winds and very hurtful; in like manner judge the contrary if you find any of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in any of his Angles, or he in any Angle from them, for this ſignifies the ſame as if they were in <hi>Conjunction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wherefore if any Planet be in an Angle or ſuccedent Houſe from the Aſcendent of the Preventional <hi>Conjunction,</hi> make him your Significator, &amp; then ſee what commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he hath with <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> or either of them; for if he be in a <hi>Square</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> or <hi>Conjunction,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> be in a fiery ſign, heat in Summer ſhall
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61337:173"/>be augmented, and in Winter cold abated; alſo if the commixture with him be by a <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> be in any fiery ſign, he denotes the ſame but not ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.</p>
                        <p>Alſo if its commixture be with <hi>Saturn</hi> by <hi>Conjunction, Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> be in cold, watry or earthy ſigns, the cold in Winter ſhall be increaſed and the heart in Summer diminiſhed; alſo if it be by <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> be in any of the aforeſaid Signs, he ſhall alſo ſignifie the ſame, but not ſo powerfully; and if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in aiery Signs which are hot and moiſt, and the commixture with the Significator be by <hi>Conjunction, Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> it ſignifieth the ayr ſhall be temperate and good, and if it be by <hi>Sextile</hi> or <hi>Trine</hi> it ſhall be the better.</p>
                        <p>Alſo if <hi>Mars</hi> have commixture with the Significator, and he be in Earthy Signs which are cold and dry, or in watery which are cold and moiſt, and it be by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, Square</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> the ayr will be good and temperate, but if it be by <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> or <hi>Trine,</hi> it will be much the betrer, and will more effectually produce the fruits and ſeeds of the Earth.</p>
                        <p>See alſo in the aforeſaid figure of the <hi>Conjunction</hi> you have chief regard to the <hi>Part of Air</hi> or <hi>Weather,</hi> and make it participate in judgment with your Significator; And if you finde <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> after the ſame manner placed, and in Aſpect therewith, judge according as you have heard of the Significator.<note place="margin">How to take part of ayr or weather, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Haly.</hi>

                        <p>To be ſhort, if you would judge of the alteration of the ayr for any quarter of the Year, erect your figures for the <hi>Sun,</hi> his ingreſs into <hi>Aries, Cancer, Libra,</hi> and <hi>Capricorn</hi> and according to the ſame method judge; if for any or every moneth, ſee when he enters the firſt Punctum of every Sign; if for any day, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Pars dierum</hi> or <hi>Part of dayes</hi> which is taken from the place of the <hi>Sun</hi> to the place of <hi>Saturn,</hi>

                        <p>There is alſo another way to judge of the Diurnal mutation of the ayr, which is to obſerve exactly the time of the <hi>Moon</hi> her entring inro the firſt point of any ſign; and having erected the figure of the Heavens for that moment ſee what Planet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth or is located within five degrees of the Cuſpe thereof, and make him Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificator of the ſtate of the weather during the time the <hi>Moon</hi> is in that ſign, and according to his ſtrength and Configurations with the other Planets judge as you have heard according to diſcretion.</p>

                           <note place="margin">How to judge of I hunder, Lightning, and Winds.</note>Thus have you been taught the alteration of the Ayr for any time of the Year, Moneth, Day, &amp;c.

                        <p>IT doth no wiſe ſeem unto me unneceſſary to deliver this Chapter unto the world; although it be not altogether ſo Aſtrological as the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are, yet by reaſon it containeth Obſervations deduced from the Stars and other Superiour things, it cannot be abſolutely rejected as not agreeing with our diſcourſe and ſubject; beſides ſince it may very well be an help both for the plainneſs and certainty thereof, to ſuch as perhaps are not of ſufficient capacity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the perfection of what we have ſet down before, I have adventured to give them to underſtand thus much.</p>

                           <note place="margin">How to judge of weather by the riſing and ſetting of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                           </note>That when the <hi>Sun</hi> riſeth clear and bright in our <hi>Horizon,</hi> it denotes a pleaſant day; but fowl weather, if then he be overcaſt with a thin cloud; if he ſet being free from clouds, a fair night followeth; alſo being then divers coloured, his beams long and red, denotes windes the next day from that part or quarter of heaven; his beams ſpotted, green, black or pale, promiſeth rain that night; if at his ſetting there be one or more circles about him, you are to obſerve whether they are red, and here and there broken; for then he denotes vehement windes that night: if obſcured thick and black circles, it ſignifies cold windes and ſnow in Winter; many circles denote winde of what colour ſoever they are, but the more if they be red; if but one circle be about him and, and that clear and of no continuance, fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be expected; underſtand the ſame of the <hi>Moon</hi> which you have heard of the <hi>Sun,</hi> when there is circles about her; blackneſs in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> denotes rain; redneſs, winde; The element red in the morning, ſhews winde and rain to enſue that day; the ſame in the Evening declares the contrary; for the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is for the moſt part then fair; and in this manner of Prognoſtication we finde the <hi>Phariſees</hi> very expert, as appears in the 16. of <hi>Matthew.</hi>

                           </note>Alſo if the <hi>Moon</hi> in the third day after the change, and the third day before the full, or in the midſt of the quarter be found of a red colour, cauſeth windes; pale and inclining to blackneſs and a muddy obſcurity, brings rain; but being bright and clear the end direct upright and free from circles promiſeth fair weather.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">By the Rain-bow.</note>Look alſo to the the time when a Rain-bow appears, and by it judge of weather thus; if it appear in fair weather, judge fowl will follow; if in fowl, fair will follow, this is the opinion of ſome, and it ſtands with very much reaſon to be true, if we look to the firſt Ordination thereof in the 9 of <hi>Gen.</hi> again if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the morning rain and moiſture is thereby portended; if in the evening, fair weather.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">By Comets.</note>From Comets if we require judgment touching theſe matters, we are to know that they never appear but they bring as well great and terrible alteration in the ayr as on the earth; but of this we ſhall have more occaſion to treat anon in the next Section; wherefore here only note that they cauſe dry weather and ayr, great and high windes, eſpecially if they appear obſcure and cloudy. And their power and efficacy judge by their greatneſs, ſmalneſs, length and ſhortneſs; they cauſe alſo ſickneſs by corruption of ayr if they appear in Aiery or Earthy ſigns.</p>

                           <note place="margin">By clouds.</note>When you ſee thick clouds and reſembling flocks gathered together in many places, they denote rain; and ſo do dark, obſcure thick clouds over the North part of Heaven declining to the Weſt; if they appear like hils and ſomewhat above the Earth, it ſhews weather over-paſſed; black clouds, promiſe rain; white clouds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in Winter two or three days together in the Eaſt part of Heaven, ſhews cold and ſnow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">By Stars.</note>When the Stars ſeem to fall which we vulgarly term ſhooting of the Stars, it prenotes winde in that part; but if they ſhoot in many places, or perhaps all over the Heavens, Inordinate windes, thunder, lightnings, and very tempeſtuous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when they ſeem to run along out of one place into another, it denotes winde; and that the weather ſhall alter from the temper wherein it is, if but few appear, and thoſe obſcure and cloudy; alſo if they at any time ſeem greater and brighter then uſual, it denotes winde and rain in theſe parts where you ſee ſuch Stars appear; and in Winter they preſage froſts, ſnow and cold weather; but herein unleſs thou art well acquainted with their Natural magnitudes thou mayeſt be deceived and canſt never be perfect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">By the Prime day.</note>Again, you may judge of the weather by the prime day thus; if it be Monday, judge moiſt weather; Tueſday, windy and cold; Wedneſday, very cold; Thurſday, fair and clear; Friday, mixt weather; Saturday, moiſt; and Sunday, dry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">By Thunder.</note>Thunder in the Morning alſo denotes winde about Noon; in the Evening, rain and tempeſt; Thunder alſo in the Winter ſhews terrible accidents and alterations the Summer following; whence the old Proverb, <hi>A Winters Thunder is a Summers won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> alſo when in any Summer you finde no Thunder, the Winter following will be very unhealthful and obnoxious to all creatures.</p>

                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What rain is.</note>Rain is a cold vapour drawn up or exhaled by the attractive faculty of the <hi>Sun</hi> to the nether part of the middle Region of the Ayr, where being thickened through cold it falleth again to the Earth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What hail and ſnow.</note>Hail and Snow are the ſame, only are drawn up higher; Snow into the middle Region, and Hail into the upper, and there condenſed and congealed into the body of a cloud, and being diſpoſed by the Configurations of fit Significators deſcendeth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What froſt and dew.</note>In like manner hoar froſt and dew is alſo the ſame vapour, and of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as is rain and the reſt, only not drawn ſo high by the <hi>Sun</hi> as to keep up, but when he with draws himſelf from our <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> falleth down again, and is by the coldneſs of the Earth congealed or reſolved into water which we call dew in Summer, but in Winter by the ſharpneſs of the ayr it is congealed into froſt, and by reaſon of the hoaryneſs of it, is called Hoare froſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What winde and the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Earth-quakes.</note>Winde alſo is but a dry exhalation drawn up from the Earth by the heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> alſo, and diſperſed here and there; and this is the reaſon of Earth-quakes; for through the gathering together of abundance of theſe vapours in the Concaves of the Earth, and from thence violently breaking out, and the Earth cloſing again, is the Earth cauſed to ſhake or as it were tremble; and this is the fore-runner of wars for the moſt part in thoſe parts of the Earth.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</note>Moreover a Comet is a flame cauſed of a dry, hot, ſlimy exhalation, drawn up by the <hi>Sun</hi> to the uppermoſt part of the ayr, the which being diſperſed and broken cauſeth high windes; but more of this in the laſt Section.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What thunder and lightning.</note>Again, Thunder is a quenching of fire in a cloud, or an exhalation hot and dry mixt with moiſture, carryed up to the middle Region, and there thickened and wraped into a cloud, where meeting with moiſture being of a contrary quality, it breaketh out the ſides of the cloud, and by this its eruption cauſeth a thundering noyſe in the ayr; and this flying out of the fire the vulgar call Lightning; the which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith comes after Thunder; but I am of opinion they come both together, though the ſenſe of ſeeing is more ſuddenly apprehenſive of the light then the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of the ſound; becauſe what is conveyed to the Eye is by a direct line, but to the Ear by an oblique; for at a diſtance we may diſcern a blow before we hear it, yet being hard by we ſhall hear it as ſoon as it is given or can be ſeen, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Lightning as ſay ſome Authours, is of marvailous efficacy, and they have made mention of three ſorts, Dry, Moiſt, and Clear; the Dry doth not burn but cleaveth trees through and alſo houſes and the like; the Moiſt doth not burn neither, but altereth colour; the Clear both burneth and deſtroyeth, and is indeed the moſt dangerous of all; for it breaketh the bones, and ſword, and bruiſeth not theskin nor breaketh the ſcabbard; and melteth moneyin the purſe, and yet melteth not wax, &amp;c.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Signs of Earth-quakes to come.</note>We are now to give the reaſon of the Eclipſing of both the Luminaries; but firſt I think it very requiſite to ſet down ſome tokens of Earth-quakes to come, which are briefly ſix; the firſt is when the <hi>Sun</hi> is obſcured and darkened without the preſence of clouds or the body of the <hi>Moon;</hi> the ſecond token that an Earth-quake is at hand, is when the <hi>Sun</hi> is as it were bloudy and coloured in ſuch a ſtrange manner; the third is when a fiery Pillar, or cloud like a pillar of fire, appears in the Heavens; the fourth is when the ayr is very quiet both at Land and Sea for a long continuance and winde abſent; the fifth when waters are ſalt and troubled, and of another taſte then uſually and naturally they are; the ſixth and laſt is when ſtrange unaccuſtomed and unuſual noiſes of exclamations of men, howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, lamentations, and clatterings of armour are heard, and ſuch ſights ſeen in the Ayr.</p>

                     <p>IN the Sixteenth Chapter of this very Fourth Book I have already declared what an Eclipſe of either of the Luminaries is, and the cauſe of that defect in each of them; wherefore it would be both needleſs and ſuperfluous here again to touch thereon. I ſhall therefore give you now the whole Method whereby to judge of any Mutation or Accident in this World portended by Eclipſes, and that in brief accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of our Predeceſſor <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> whom I prefer for his ſhortneſs and plainneſs before any or all other Writings that I have mett with; it is true, <hi>Leovitius</hi> hath been very large on this ſubject, and others; but ſince what <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us, is ſufficient for inſtruction to any that are to ſeek in theſe matters, I ſhall paſs them by as more myſterious and intricate, and yet tending no more to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt Section and firſt Chapter of this Fourth Book you have been taught that in your judgement of Revolutions you are to conſider the place of the Eclipſes of either Luminaries or both, if any ſuch happen, and joyn them in judgement; for if there be any Eclipſe or Eclipſes, you are to ſee if there be any agreement betwixt them and the Lord of the Year and Aſcendent of the Revolutions; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain then that there followeth many inconveniencies and alterations in the World after any of the great Lights are Eclipſed; for by them all things have their ſubſiſtence and nutriment in a natural way; and therefore it muſt needs follow ſublunary things muſt ſuffer detriment in one kinde or other when either of them are deprived of their lights and influences, eſpecially if both in one Moneth; whence <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> ſaith,<label type="milestone">

                        </label> There ſhall much inconveniency and trouble happen in the World when both the Luminaries ſhall be Eclipſed in one Moneth, and chiefly in thoſe places in which their Effects ſhall be manifeſted.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore in any Year if either or both the Luminaries are Eclipſed, or in any quarterly Revolution, ſee if the Lord of the Sign wherein the Eclipſe is to fall, be ſtrong or weak, or in <hi>Conjunction</hi> or any Configuration with the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at the time of the middle of the Eclipſe (which you are to know is the time wherein you are to erect your Scheme or Figure of the Heavens for the judging of the Effects of any Eclipſe) or with the Lord of the Year or Quarter,<note place="margin">What time the figure of Heaven is to be erected for the judging of Eclipſes.</note> or whether the Fortunes behold theſe or the Infortunes: for if the Fortunes, you are to judge good; if the Infortunes, the contrary. The nature and quality thereof judge from good; if the Infortunes, the contrary. The nature and quality thereof judge from the nature of the Significators, as you have heard before: likewiſe whether much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or good is to be expected by conſidering the ſtrength of your Significators and their Receptions and nature of their Aſpects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What things or places are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified good or evill in any Eclipſe.</note>And judge this evill or good to thoſe ſignified by the Planet in Configuration with theſe Lords or the Fortunes or Infortunes, whether men or things: as if the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or its Lord be beheld by the Fortunes, then you may ſafely ſay the People of that Nation or Kingdom wherein the Revoluton is, ſhall be ſafe, of good health and proſperous, &amp;c. and ſo judge of all the reſt of the Houſes according to their
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61337:178"/>ſeveral ſignifications, as you have been taught before: and ſo on the contrary evill, if by the Infortunes: And this ſhall be the more encreaſed if the Lord of the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or Lord of the Year be the Lord of the Sign wherein the Eclipſe is to happen. In like manner pronounce evill and dammage to the perſons and things ſignified by any other Houſe of whom you find the Lord of the Sign of the Eclipſe Ruler, &amp;c. Judge the time when it ſhall be moſt grievous unto them, to be when the <hi>Sun</hi> comes to the ſame Houſe in the Eclipſe (I mean the very degree and minute of the Cuſp) whereby they are ſignified, or to the degree and minute of the Zodiack their chief Sgnificator was then in: as if it be the Common People, when the <hi>Sun</hi> comes to the degree and minute of the Aſcendent at the time of the middle of the Eclipſe: if it be the Rulers or King, it will be moſt grievous when the <hi>Sun</hi> comes to the degree and minute of the Tenth Houſe at that time; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Detriment and miſchief alſo is to be expected to all things ſignified by the Houſe wherein any Eclipſe is: as if in the Tenth, to Kings, Grandees and chief Rulers: if in the Ninth, to Church-men: in the Eighth, the death of Old men, &amp;c. and it ſhall be chiefly incident unto men, if any Eclipſe be in Humane Signs: if in Aiery, to Birds: if in Earthy, to the Fruits of the Earth and Seeds: (yet <hi>Junctinus</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth us, that if an Eclipſe be in <hi>Libra,</hi> it ſignifies the rottenneſs of Herbs, and that there ſhall be Sects and Schiſms amongſt Church-men) in watery, to the Fiſh and Creatures living in the Watery Element: in Beſtial Signs, to Beaſts, according to the nature of the Sign: as if <hi>Aries,</hi> to Sheep: if <hi>Capricorn,</hi> to Goats: if <hi>Taurus,</hi> to Bulls, Cows and Oxen: if <hi>Sagittary,</hi> the laſt 15 degrees, to Horſes, &amp;c. and if feral ſigns, to wild Beaſts.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The third is the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the firſt term or degree of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and this is once in thirty years.</p>
